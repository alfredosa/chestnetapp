We report that CD8+CD122+CD49dlo T regulatory-like cells (CD8+ TRLs) are among the earliest lymphocytes to infiltrate mouse brains after ischemic stroke and temper inflammation; they also confer neuroprotection. TRL depletion worsened stroke outcomes, an effect reversed by CD8+ TRL reconstitution. The CXCR3/CXCL10 axis served as the brain-homing mechanism for CD8+ TRLs. Upon brain entry, CD8+ TRLs were reprogrammed to upregulate leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, epidermal growth factor-like transforming growth factor (ETGF), and interleukin 10 (IL-10). LIF/LIF receptor interactions induced ETGF and IL-10 production in CD8+ TRLs. While IL-10 induction was important for the antiinflammatory effects of CD8+ TRLs, ETGF provided direct neuroprotection. Poststroke intravenous transfer of CD8+ TRLs reduced infarction, promoting long-term neurological recovery in young males or aged mice of both sexes. Thus, these unique CD8+ TRLs serve as early responders to rally defenses against stroke, offering fresh perspectives for clinical translation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Microglia are important resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and play an important role in its development, homeostasis, and disease treatments. Activated microglia perform diverse functions in mouse models of CNS neurodegenerative diseases or deficits. In humans, microglia have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Following brain or spinal cord injury, microglia express pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes at different stages of recovery. With the development of pharmacological and genetic tools for microglial depletion, studies have demonstrated that microglial depletion exerts both positive and negative effects in the treatment of CNS diseases. Notably, microglial depletion provides an empty niche that stimulates production of new microglia. Microglial depletion and repopulation can not only treat diseases by eliminating dysfunctional microglia but can also provide an indication of the molecular mechanisms of diseases. Although this approach has shown impressive results, its use is still in its infancy. In this review, we summarize the current pharmacological and genetic tools for microglial depletion and highlight recent advances in microglial repopulation therapy for the treatment and functional recovery of neurological diseases and deficits. Finally, we briefly discuss the therapeutic challenges and prospective uses of microglial repopulation therapy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are normally born in the thymus and activated in secondary lymphoid tissues to suppress immune responses in the lymph node and at sites of inflammation. Tregs are also resident in various tissues or accumulate in damaged tissues, which are now called tissue Tregs, and contribute to homeostasis and tissue repair by interacting with non-immune cells. We have shown that Tregs accumulate in the brain during the chronic phase in a mouse cerebral infarction model, and these Tregs acquire the characteristic properties of brain Tregs and contribute to the recovery of neurological damage by interacting with astrocytes. However, the mechanism of tissue Treg development is not fully understood. We developed a culture method that confers brain Treg characteristics . Naive Tregs from the spleen were activated and efficiently amplified by T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in the presence of primary astrocytes. Furthermore, adding IL-33 and serotonin could confer part of the properties of brain Tregs, such as ST2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and serotonin receptor 7 (Htr7) expression. Transcriptome analysis revealed that  generated brain Treg-like Tregs (induced brain Tregs; iB-Tregs) showed similar gene expression patterns as those in  brain Tregs, although they were not identical. Furthermore, in Parkinson's disease models, in which T cells have been shown to be involved in disease progression, iB-Tregs infiltrated into the brain more readily and ameliorated pathological symptoms more effectively than splenic Tregs. These data indicate that iB-Tregs contribute to our understanding of brain Treg development and could also be therapeutic for inflammatory brain diseases.\",\n",

Stroke was induced via middle cerebral artery electrocoagulation in 8-9-week old mice (young mice), 18\\xa0month old mice (aged mice), and in high-fat diet-fed 22-week old ApoE-/- mice (hyperlipidaemic mice). Recovery was evaluated using motor behavioural tests 3 and 7\\xa0days after stroke. Tissue damage was evaluated at 7\\xa0days. A lower dose of fingolimod, 0.5\\xa0mg/kg, but not 1\\xa0mg/kg, increased lesion size but decreased ipsilateral brain atrophy in younger mice, without an effect on behavioural outcomes. Fingolimod-treated aged mice showed a significant improvement over saline-treated mice in the foot fault test at 7\\xa0days. Fingolimod-treated hyperlipidaemic mice showed a decreased infarct size but no difference in behavioural performance. Increasing fingolimod treatment time to 10\\xa0days showed no benefit in young mice. Pooled data showed that fingolimod improved performance in the foot fault test. Flow cytometry studies showed that fingolimod had marked effects on T cell frequencies in various tissues. The results show that the effects of fingolimod in stroke are less robust than the existing literature might indicate and may depend on the inflammatory status of the animals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Infections by viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could cause organ inflammations such as myocarditis, pneumonia and encephalitis. Innate immunity to viral nucleic acids mediates antiviral immunity as well as inflammatory organ injury. However, the innate immune mechanisms that control viral induced organ inflammations are unclear. To understand the role of the E3 ligase TRIM18 in controlling viral myocarditis and organ inflammation, wild-type and Trim18 knockout mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 for inducing viral myocarditis, influenza A virus PR8 strain and human adenovirus for inducing viral pneumonia, and herpes simplex virus type I for inducing herpes simplex encephalitis. Mice survivals were monitored, and heart, lung and brain were harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry analysis. Real-time PCR, co-immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, luciferase assay, flow cytometry, over-expression and knockdown techniques were used to understand the molecular mechanisms of TRIM18 in regulating type I interferon (IFN) production after virus infection in this study. We find that knockdown or deletion of TRIM18 in human or mouse macrophages enhances production of type I IFN in response to double strand (ds) RNA and dsDNA or RNA and DNA virus infection. Importantly, deletion of TRIM18 protects mice from viral myocarditis, viral pneumonia, and herpes simplex encephalitis due to enhanced type I IFN production in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that TRIM18 recruits protein phosphatase 1A (PPM1A) to dephosphorylate TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which inactivates TBK1 to block TBK1 from interacting with its upstream adaptors, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING), thereby dampening antiviral signaling during viral infections. Moreover, TRIM18 stabilizes PPM1A by inducing K63-linked ubiquitination of PPM1A. Our results indicate that TRIM18 serves as a negative regulator of viral myocarditis, lung inflammation and brain damage by downregulating innate immune activation induced by both RNA and DNA viruses. Our data reveal that TRIM18 is a critical regulator of innate immunity in viral induced diseases, thereby identifying a potential therapeutic target for treatment. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Adverse early-life experiences are risk factors for psychiatric disease development, resulting in stress-related neuronal modeling and neurobehavioral changes. Stressful experiences modulate the immune system, contributing to neuronal damage in higher cortical regions, like the hippocampus. Moreover, early-life stressors dysregulate the function of microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, in the developing hippocampus. Paternal deprivation, an early-life stressor in many biparental species, facilitates sex-dependent inhibitions in hippocampal plasticity, but parental contributors to these sex-specific outcomes are unknown. Also, neurobiological mechanisms contributing to impairments in hippocampal neuroplasticity are less known. Thus, our goals were to 1) determine whether parental behavior is altered in maternal females following removal of the paternal male, 2) assess the effects of paternal deprivation on dentate gyrus (DG) volume and microglia proliferation, and 3) determine if early-life experimental handling mitigates sex-specific reductions in DG cell survival. California mice were born to multiparous breeders and reared by both parents (biparental care) or by their mother alone (i.e., father removed on postnatal day 1; paternal deprivation). One cohort of offspring underwent offspring retrieval tests for eight days beginning on postnatal day 2. On PND 68, these offspring (and a second cohort of mice without behavioral testing) were euthanized and brains visualized for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (TuJ-1) or ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1). While mate absence did not impair maternal retrieval, paternal deprivation reduced DG volume, but Iba1+ cell density was only higher in paternally-deprived females. Neither sex or paternal deprivation significantly altered the number of BrdU+ or Tuj1+ cells in the DG - an absence of a reduction in cell survival may be related to daily handing during early offspring retrieval tests. Together, these data suggest that paternal deprivation impairs hippocampal plasticity; however, sex and early environment may influence the magnitude of these outcomes.',\n",

These unique rodents use metabolic rate depression along with various molecular mechanisms to successfully overcome the challenges of oxygen-limitation, which they experience in their underground borrows. While studies have reported that naked mole-rats exhibit inherently higher levels of oxidative damage across their lifespan as compared to mice, it has yet to be determined whether naked mole-rats are vulnerable to oxidative damage during periods of low oxygen exposure. To investigate this phenomenon, we examined cellular oxidative damage markers of macromolecules: DNA oxidation determined as 8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG8) levels, RNA oxidation as 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation in normoxic (control), acute (4\\xa0h at 7% O), and chronic (24\\xa0h at 7% O) hypoxia-exposed naked mole-rats. Brain appears to be the most resilient to hypoxia-induced oxidative damage, with both brain and heart exhibiting enhanced antioxidant capacity during hypoxia. Levels of DNA and RNA oxidation were minimally changed in all tissues and no changes were observed in protein carbonylation. Most tissues experienced lipid peroxidation, with liver displaying a 9.6-fold increase during hypoxia. Concomitantly, levels of DNA damage repair proteins were dynamically regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with white adipose displaying a significant reduction during hypoxia. Our findings show that naked mole-rats largely avoid hypoxia-induced oxidative damage, possibly due to their high tolerance to redox stress, or to reduced oxidative requirements made possible during their hypometabolic response when oxygen supply is limited.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'At present, one of the main therapeutic challenges comprises the development of technologies to improve the life quality of people suffering from different types of body paralysis, through the reestablishment of sensory and motor functions. In this regard, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) offer hope to effectively mitigate body paralysis through the control of paralyzed body parts by brain activity. Invasive BMI use chronic multielectrode implants to record neural activity directly from the brain tissue. While such invasive devices provide the highest amount of usable neural activity for BMI control, they also involve direct damage to the nervous tissue. In the cerebral cortex, high levels of the enzyme NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) characterize a particular class of interneurons that regulates neuronal excitability and blood supply. To gain insight into the biocompatibility of invasive BMI, we assessed the impact of chronic implanted tungsten multielectrode bundles on the distribution and morphology of NADPH-d-reactive neurons in the rat frontal cortex. NADPH-d neuronal labeling was correlated with glial response markers and with indices of healthy neuronal activity measured by electrophysiological recordings performed up to 3\\xa0months after multielectrode implantation. Chronic electrode arrays caused a small and quite localized structural disturbance on the implanted site, with neuronal loss and glial activation circumscribed to the site of implant. Electrodes remained viable during the entire period of implantation. Moreover, neither the distribution nor the morphology of NADPH-d neurons was altered. Overall, our findings provide additional evidence that tungsten multielectrodes can be employed as a viable element for long-lasting therapeutic BMI applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Balance disorders affect approximately 30% of the population throughout their lives and result in debilitating symptoms, such as spontaneous vertigo, nystagmus, and oscillopsia. The main cause of balance disorders is peripheral vestibular dysfunction, which may occur as a result of hair cell loss, neural dysfunction, or mechanical (and morphological) abnormality. The most common cause of vestibular dysfunction is arguably vestibular hair cell damage, which can result from an array of factors, such as ototoxicity, trauma, genetics, and ageing. One promising therapy is the vestibular prosthesis, which leverages the success of the cochlear implant, and endeavours to electrically integrate the primary vestibular afferents with the vestibular scene. Other translational approaches of interest include stem cell regeneration and gene therapies, which aim to restore or modify inner ear receptor function. However, both of these techniques are in their infancy and are currently undergoing further characterization and development in the laboratory, using animal models. Another promising translational avenue to treating vestibular hair cell dysfunction is the potential development of artificial biocompatible hair cell sensors, aiming to replicate functional hair cells and generate synthetic 'receptor potentials' for sensory coding of vestibular stimuli to the brain. Recently, artificial hair cell sensors have demonstrated significant promise, with improvements in their output, such as sensitivity and frequency selectivity. This article reviews the history and current state of bioelectronic devices to interface with the labyrinth, spanning the vestibular implant and artificial hair cell sensors.\",\n",

Currently, human endometrium-derived adventitial cells (En-ADVs) are considered ideal seed cells with high pluripotency for regenerative medicine. However, critical issues such as noninvasive repair of tissues, targeting of native stem cells, and continuous action in the injured sites are not well resolved. Herein, En-ADV spheroid-loaded hierarchical microneedles (MN/En-ADV) for in situ intrauterine repair are developed. The flexible microneedles are fabricated with gelatin methacryloyl and lactoferrin, imparting the characteristics of rapid degradation and antimicrobial activity. Benefiting from an array of microwells on microneedles, En-ADVs can rapidly form 3D cell spheroids, which display higher potential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration than dissociated cells. With the application of MN/En-ADV, the repaired uteri show well-defined myometrial regeneration, angiogenesis, and an increase of endometrial receptivity in a rat AS model. Notably, embryos are able to implant in the reconstructed sites and remain viable, indicating that this system promotes the restoration of both normal morphology and reproductive function in the injured uterus. It is anticipated that multifunctional MN/En-ADV can be an ideal candidate for versatile in situ tissue regeneration.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) has shown promise in restoring quality of life to patients suffering from paralysis, specifically when used in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, these benefits can be hampered by long-term degradation of electrode performance due to the brain's foreign body response. Advances in microfabrication techniques have allowed for the development of neuroprostheses with subcellular electrodes, which are characterized by greater versatility and a less detrimental immune response during chronic use. These probes are hypothesized to enable more selective, higher-resolution stimulation of cortical tissue with long-term implants. However, microstimulation using physiologically relevant charges with these smaller-scale devices can damage electrode sites and reduce the efficacy of the overall device. Studies have shown promise in bypassing this limitation by spreading the stimulation charge between multiple channels in an implanted electrode array, but to our knowledge the usefulness of this strategy in laminar arrays with electrode sites spanning each layer of the cortex remains unexplored. To investigate the efficacy of simultaneous multi-channel ICMS in electrode arrays with stimulation sites spanning cortical depth, we implanted laminar electrode arrays in the primary somatosensory cortex of rats trained in a behavioral avoidance paradigm. By measuring detection thresholds, we were able to quantify improvements in ICMS performance using a simultaneous multi-channel stimulation paradigm. The charge required per site to elicit detection thresholds was halved when stimulating from two adjacent electrode sites, although the overall charge used by the implant was increased. This reduction in threshold charge was more pronounced when stimulating with more than two channels and lessened with greater distance between stimulating channels. Our findings suggest that these improvements are based on the synchronicity and polarity of each stimulus, leading us to conclude that these improvements in stimulation efficiency per electrode are due to charge summation as opposed to a summation of neural responses to stimulation. Additionally, the per-site charge reductions are seen regardless of the cortical depth of each utilized channel. This evocation of physiological detection thresholds with lower stimulation currents per electrode site has implications for the feasibility of stimulation regimes in future advanced neuroprosthetic devices, which could benefit from reducing the charge output per site.\",\n",

These have advantages such as compatibility with integrated microchips, simple implantation and high-density nanofabrication but tend to be lacking in terms of biointegration, biocompatibility and durability due to their mechanical rigidity. This leads to damage to the device or, more importantly, the brain tissue surrounding the implant. Flexible polymer-based probes offer superior biocompatibility in terms of surface biochemistry and better matched mechanical properties. Research which aims to bring the fabrication of electronics on flexible polymer substrates to the nano-regime is remarkably sparse, despite the push for flexible consumer electronics in the last decade or so. Cleanroom-based nanofabrication techniques such as photolithography have been used as pattern transfer methods by the semiconductor industry to produce single nanometre scale devices and are now also used for making flexible circuit boards. There is still much scope for miniaturizing flexible electronics further using photolithography, bringing the possibility of nanoscale, non-invasive, high-density flexible neural interfacing.

       "  'abstract': 'In the last few years, we have been exploring the use of transparent nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (nc-YSZ) ceramics as a biomedical transparent cranial implant, referred as the \"Window to the Brain\" (WttB). The WttB aims at providing chronical optical access to the brain for diagnostics and therapeutic procedures and it has shown to provide an effective means to obtain enhanced results from optical imaging techniques. The objective of this work is to explore the photothermal effects of the Wttb produced when it is irradiated by a laser source. We make experimental and computer models. The thermal effects of laser irradiation on the nc-YSZ samples were evaluated upon registering the induced temperature changes by means of thermal imaging. The computer models try to mimic the experimental models using a similar geometry, reproducing the physical situation by a couple thermal-optical problem and adjusting the main parameters from the experimental results. Experimental and computational coincides in results: Temperatures at the bottom surface of the implant does not exceed those which produce thermal damage. The quantitative comparison between experimental and computational models show that differences in results are under a reasonable value of 5% and qualitatively we observe a similar behavior. The results provide optimum values for the thermal-optical nc-YSZ parameters considering a linear and exponential relationship with temperature for the absorption coefficient: The thermal conductivity is k\\xa0=\\xa02.13\\xa0W/m·K and the absorption coefficient α varies from 426 to 526\\xa0m with the linear relationship, and k\\xa0=\\xa02.04\\xa0W/m·K and α ∈ [433,502]\\xa0m with the exponential. The reflection coefficient is R\\xa0=\\xa019% in both cases. The temperatures achieved in the nc-YSZ during the laser irradiation are suitable for biomedical applications. The combination of experimental and computational models contributes to build a clinically oriented model with the thermal-optical parameters values stablished and to determine their influence in results. Specifically, the absorption coefficient of the nc-YSZ samples is the most influent parameter in the obtained temperatures. Moreover, this combination provides a method to evaluate the relevant thermal-optical parameters of nc-YSZ samples obtained with different manufacturing processes. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The procedure for installation of a percutaneous bone-conducting device has undergone significant improvements since its introduction 40 years ago. Today, the linear incision technique with tissue preservation (LITT-P) and the minimally invasive procedure (MIPS) are the most commonly used approaches. In both these techniques, a gradual increase of the osteotomy using a three-step drilling sequence is utilized, as this approach can allow a stepwise deepening and widening of the osteotomy in the mastoid and can prevent bone overheating. A new minimally invasive procedure (MONO) has been developed that allows an osteotomy to be performed and enables complete removal of the bone volume in one single drill step for a 4 mm implant using a novel parabolic twist drill. Here, the feasibility of the MONO procedure was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in terms of the dura response to drill trauma in comparison with the outcomes achieved with guide drills used for the LITT-P and MIPS techniques. Fresh frozen temporal bone from a human cadaver was subjected to penetration by three drills beyond the base of the mastoid bone to different depths. The sites were evaluated, and the damage to and possible penetration of the dura were determined. The results showed that for a drill depth exceeding mastoid bone thickness by not more than 1 mm, damage to the dura was limited or nonexistent, whereas for a drill depth exceeding bone thickness by 2 mm, damage increased, or the dura was penetrated. There was a trend toward more damage and penetration for both the round burr and MIPS guide drill compared with the MONO drill bit. From this experimental  study, it can be concluded that if the dura is encountered, the MONO system is not more inclined to penetrate the dura than the conventional LITT-P and MIPS systems.',\n",

By recording and transmitting nerve signals with electrodes, people can control the external machines. At the same time, using electrodes to electrically stimulate nerve tissue, people with long-term brain diseases will be safely and reliably treated. Young's modulus of the traditional rigid electrode probe is not matched well with that of biological tissue, and tissue immune rejection is easy to generate, resulting in the electrode not being able to achieve long-term safety and reliable working. In recent years, the choice of flexible materials and design of electrode structures can achieve modulus matching between electrode and biological tissue, and tissue damage is decreased. This review discusses nerve microelectrodes based on flexible electrode materials and substrate materials. Simultaneously, different structural designs of neural microelectrodes are reviewed. However, flexible electrode probes are difficult to implant into the brain. Only with the aid of certain auxiliary devices, can the implant be safe and reliable.

       "  'abstract': 'Hearing loss in patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) is commonly attributed to mechanical compression of the auditory nerve, though recent studies suggest that this retrocochlear pathology may be augmented by cochlear damage. Although VS-associated loss of inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and spiral ganglion cells has been reported, it is unclear to what extent auditory-nerve peripheral axons are damaged in VS patients. Understanding the degree of damage VSs cause to auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) is important for accurately modeling clinical outcomes of cochlear implantation, which is a therapeutic option to rehabilitate hearing in VS-affected ears. A retrospective analysis of human temporal-bone histopathology was performed on archival specimens from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear collection. Seven patients met our inclusion criteria based on the presence of sporadic, unilateral, untreated VS. Tangential sections of five cochlear regions were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and adjacent sections were stained to visualize myelinated ANFs and efferent fibers. Following confocal microscopy, peripheral axons of ANFs within the osseous spiral lamina were quantified manually, where feasible, and with a \"pixel counting\" method, applicable to all sections. ANF density was substantially reduced on the VS side compared to the unaffected contralateral side. In the upper basal turn, a significant difference between the VS side and unaffected contralateral side was found using both counting methods, corresponding to the region tuned to 2000\\xa0Hz. Even spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) contralateral to VS were affected by the tumor as the majority of contralateral SGC counts were below average for age. This observation provides histological insight into the clinical observation that unilateral vestibular schwannomas pose a long-term risk of progression of hearing loss in the contralateral ear as well. Our pixel counting method for ANF quantification in the osseous spiral lamina is applicable to other pathologies involving sensorineural hearing loss. Future research is needed to classify ANFs into morphological categories, accurately predict their electrical properties, and use this knowledge to inform optimal cochlear implant programming strategies.',\n",

Applications of such devices include stimulation or sensing and could enable direct placement near regions of interest within the brain without the need for electrode leads or separate battery compartments that are at increased risk of breakage and infection. Clinical use of leadless brain implants is accompanied by novel risks, such as migration of the implant. Additionally, the encapsulation material of the implants plays an important role in mitigating unwanted tissue reactions. These risks have the potential to cause harm or reduce the service of life of the implant. In the present study, we have assessed post-implantation tissue reaction and migration of borosilicate glass-encapsulated micro-implants within the cortex of the brain. Twenty borosilicate glass-encapsulated devices (2 × 3.5 × 20 mm) were implanted into the parenchyma of 10 sheep for 6 months. Radiographs were taken directly post-surgery and at 3 and 6 months. Subsequently, sheep were euthanized, and GFAP and IBA-1 histological analysis was performed. The migration of the implants was tracked by reference to two stainless steel screws placed in the skull. We found no significant difference in fluoroscopy intensity of GFAP and a small difference in IBA-1 between implanted tissue and control. There was no glial scar formation found at the site of the implant's track wall. Furthermore, we observed movement of up to 4.6 mm in a subset of implants in the first 3 months of implantation and no movement in any implant during the 3-6-month period of implantation. Subsequent histological analysis revealed no evidence of a migration track or tissue damage. We conclude that the implantation of this discrete micro-implant within the brain does not present additional risk due to migration.\",\n",

This form of siderosis is caused by chronic cerebral hemorrhages, especially subarachnoid hemorrhages. The diversity of symptoms depends on the respective damage to the brain, but in most of the cases it shows up as incipient unilateral or bilateral hearing loss, ataxia and signs of pyramidal tracts. We are investigating the question of whether cochlear implantation is a treatment option for patients with superficial hemosiderosis and which strategy of diagnostic procedure has to be ruled out preoperatively. In a tertiary hospital between 2009 and 2018, we examined (N\\u2009=\\u20095) patients with radiologically confirmed central hemosiderosis who suffered from profound hearing loss to deafness were treated with a cochlear implant (CI). We compared pre- and postoperative speech comprehension (Freiburg speech intelligibility test for monosyllables and HSM sentence test). Speech understanding improved on average by 20% (monosyllabic test in the Freiburg speech intelligibility test) and by 40% in noise (HSM sentence test) compared to preoperative speech understanding with optimized hearing aids. The results show that patients with superficial siderosis benefit from CI with better speech understanding. The results are below the average for all postlingual deaf CI patients. Superficial siderosis causes neural damages, which explains the reduced speech understanding based on central hearing loss. It is important to correctly weigh the patient's expectations preoperatively and to include neurologists within the therapy procedure. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Macrophages are abundant in the cochlea; however, their role in hearing loss is not well understood. Insults to the cochlea, such as noise or insertion of a cochlear implant, cause an inflammatory response, which includes activation of tissue-resident macrophages. Activation is characterized by changes in macrophage morphology, mediator expression, and distribution. Evidence from other organs shows activated macrophages can become primed, whereby subsequent insults cause an elevated inflammatory response. Primed macrophages in brain pathologies respond to circulating inflammatory mediators by disproportionate synthesis of inflammatory mediators. This signaling occurs behind an intact blood-brain barrier, similar to the blood-labyrinth barrier in the cochlea. Local tissue damage can occur as the result of mediator release by activated macrophages. Damage is typically localized; however, if it is to structures with limited ability to repair, such as neurons or hair cells within the cochlea, it is feasible that this contributes to the progressive loss of function seen in hearing loss. We propose that macrophages in the cochlea link risk factors and hearing loss. Injury to the cochlea causes local macrophage activation that typically resolves. However, in susceptible individuals, some macrophages enter a primed state. Once primed, these macrophages can be further activated, as a consequence of circulating inflammatory molecules associated with common co-morbidities. Hypothetically, this would lead to further cochlear damage and loss of hearing. We review the evidence for the role of tissue-resident macrophages in the cochlea and propose that cochlear macrophages contribute to the trajectory of hearing loss and warrant further study.',\n",

However, almost one third of patients also develop neurological symptoms. The aim of the present study is to describe the case of a previously health adult that evolved cerebral ventricular empyema in the IV ventricle during COVID-19 infection treatment. A 49-year-old man with COVID-19 developed pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant . After treating adequate treatment, sedation was switched off without showing appropriate awakening. Brain CT was performed with evidence of communicating hydrocephalus. External ventricular shunt (EVD) was implant with intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid suggestive of meningitis with a positive culture for oxacillin-sensitive . Twenty days after EVD, meningitis treatment was finished and with 2 negative cultures, conversion to ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed. In the following week, during the evaluation of the patient in intensive care, quadriplegia and absence of spontaneous respiratory movement were evidenced, just maintaining head movement. Brain MRI was performed with a diagnosis of ventriculitis associated with pus collections on the IV ventricle. The patient underwent microsurgical drainage removal of the shunt, with a positive intraventricular collection culture for  carbapenemase and multidrug-resistant , without improvement in the neurological condition. After 14 weeks of hospitalization, the patient died. It is well known that COVID-19 has potential to directly attack and cause severe damage to the central nervous system; however, ventricular empyema is an extremely rare life-threatening complication.

       "  'abstract': \"Studies have reported that synaptic failure occurs before the Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset. The systemic Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) infection is involved in memory decline. We previously showed that leptomeningeal cells, covering the brain, activate glial cells by releasing IL-1β in response to systemic inflammation. In the present study, we focused on the impact of leptomeningeal cells on neurons during systemic P. gingivalis infection. The responses of leptomeningeal cells and cortical neurons to systemic P. gingivalis infection were examined in 15-month-old mice. The mechanism of IL-1β production by P. gingivalis infected leptomeningeal cells was examined, and primary cortical neurons were treated with P. gingivalis infected leptomeningeal cells condition medium (Pg LCM). Systemic P. gingivalis infection increased the expression of IL-1β in leptomeninges and reduced the synaptophysin (SYP) expression in leptomeninges proximity cortex in mice. Leptomeningeal cells phagocytosed P. gingivalis resulting in lysosomal rupture and cathepsin B (CatB) leakage. Leaked CatB mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation inducing IL-1β secretion in leptomeningeal cells. Pg LCM decreased the expression of synaptic molecules, including SYP, which was inhibited by an IL-1 receptor antagonist pre-treatment. These observations demonstrate that P. gingivalis infection is involved in synaptic failure by inducing CatB/NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production in leptomeningeal cells. The periodontal bacteria-induced synaptic damage may accelerate the onset and cognitive decline of AD. \",\n",

Variability in functionality of electrodes has been reported but few studies in humans have examined the impact of chronic brain tissue responses revealed postmortem on electrode performanceIn a tetraplegic man, recording MEAs were implanted into the anterior intraparietal area and Brodmann's area 5 (BA5) of the posterior parietal cortex and a recording and stimulation array was implanted in BA1 of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The participant expired from unrelated causes seven months after MEA implantation. The underlying tissue of two of the three devices was processed for histology and electrophysiological recordings were assessed.Recordings of neuronal activity were obtained from all three MEAs despite meningeal encapsulation. However, the S1 array had a greater encapsulation, yielded lower signal quality than the other arrays and failed to elicit somatosensory percepts with electrical stimulation. Histological examination of tissues underlying S1 and BA5 implant sites revealed localized leptomeningeal proliferation and fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates, astrogliosis, and foreign body reaction around the electrodes. The BA5 recording site showed focal cerebral microhemorrhages and leptomeningeal vascular ectasia. The S1 site showed focal tissue damage including vascular recanalization, neuronal loss, and extensive subcortical white matter necrosis. The tissue response at the S1 site included hemorrhagic-induced injury suggesting a likely mechanism for reduced function of the S1 implant.Our findings are similar to those from animal studies with chronic intracortical implants and suggest that vascular disruption and microhemorrhage during device implantation are important contributors to overall array and individual electrode performance and should be a topic for future device development to mitigate tissue responses.

As radiotherapy and chemotherapy act through the induction of DNA damage, the sensitization of cancer cells through the inhibition of DNA damage repair pathways is a potential therapeutic strategy. The poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor veliparib was assessed for its ability to augment the cellular response to radiation-induced DNA damage in human medulloblastoma cells. DNA repair following irradiation was assessed using the alkaline comet assay, with veliparib inhibiting the rate of DNA repair. Veliparib treatment also increased the number of γH2AX foci in cells treated with radiation, and analysis of downstream pathways indicated persistent activation of the DNA damage response pathway. Clonogenicity assays demonstrated that veliparib effectively inhibited the colony-forming capacity of medulloblastoma cells, both as a single agent and in combination with irradiation. These data were then validated  using an orthotopic implant model of medulloblastoma. Mice harboring intracranial D425 medulloblastoma xenografts were treated with vehicle, veliparib, 18 Gy multifractionated craniospinal irradiation (CSI), or veliparib combined with 18 Gy CSI. Animals treated with combination therapy exhibited reduced tumor growth rates concomitant with increased intra-tumoral apoptosis observed by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed a statistically significant increase in survival with combination therapy compared to CSI alone. In summary, PARP inhibition enhanced radiation-induced cytotoxicity of medulloblastoma cells; thus, veliparib or other brain-penetrant PARP inhibitors are potential radiosensitizing agents for the treatment of medulloblastoma.',\n",

Treatment for trigeminal neuropathic pain remains a challenge, as common drugs either do not demonstrate beneficial therapeutic effects or induce intolerance in patients. In a rat model of trigeminal neuropathic pain, pain caused by the malpositioning of dental implants is similar to that experienced by humans. We used masculine Sprague-Dawley rats with inferior alveolar nerve damage as a model to investigate the differential regulation of NLRP3. First, we confirmed the level of NLRP3 in the medullary dorsal horn and variation of pain response behavior after silencing the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome bodies in rats with trigeminal neuropathic pain. Second, under localized anesthesia, we extracted the lower left second molar, implanted a micro-dental implant, and deliberately injured the inferior alveolar nerve. After nerve damage, the level of NLRP3-related inflammasomes was upregulated in microglia and the expression of a component of the inflammasome gradually increased during postoperative days 3-21. The suppression of adenovirus-shRNA-NLRP3 on postoperative day 1 markedly inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of the inflammasome and mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, it attenuated cell death in microglia, as evidenced by increased Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bik expression. The level of NLRP3 in the dorsal horn is a pivotal factor in trigeminal neuropathic pain, and inhibition of the early expression of NLRP3 might serve as a potential therapeutic approach. ',\n",

Minuscule wirelessly-powered devices have the potential to provide minimally-invasive interactions with neurons in chronic research and medical applications. However, these devices face a seemingly simple problem-how can they be placed into nervous tissue rapidly, efficiently and in an essentially arbitrary location?. We introduce a novel injection tool and describe a controlled injection approach that minimizes damage to the tissue.To validate the needle injectable tool and the presented delivery approach, we evaluate the spatial precision and rotational alignment of the microdevices injected into agarose, brain, and sciatic nerve with the aid of tissue clearing and MRI imaging. In this research, we limited the number of injections into the brain to four per rat as we are using microdevices that are designed for an adult head size on a rat model. We then present immunohistology data to assess the damage caused by the needle.. By virtue of its simplicity, the proposed injection method can be used to inject microdevices of all sizes and shapes and will do so in a fast, minimally-invasive, and cost-effective manner. As a result, the introduced technique can be broadly used to accelerate the validation of these next-generation types of electrodes in animal models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Gravity is a pervasive environmental stimulus, and accurate graviception is required for optimal spatial orientation and postural stability. The primary graviceptors are the vestibular organs, which include angular velocity (semicircular canals) and linear acceleration (otolith organs) sensors. Graviception is degraded in patients with vestibular damage, resulting in spatial misperception and imbalance. Since minimal therapy is available for these patients, substantial effort has focused on developing a vestibular prosthesis or vestibular implant (VI) that reproduces information normally provided by the canals (since reproducing otolith function is very challenging technically). Prior studies demonstrated that angular eye velocity responses could be driven by canal VI-mediated angular head velocity information, but it remains unknown whether a canal VI could improve spatial perception and posture since these behaviors require accurate estimates of angular head position in space relative to gravity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a canal VI that transduces angular head velocity and provides this information to the brain via motion-modulated electrical stimulation of canal afferent nerves could improve the perception of angular head position relative to gravity in monkeys with severe vestibular damage. Using a subjective visual vertical task, we found that normal female monkeys accurately sensed the orientation of the head relative to gravity during dynamic tilts, that this ability was degraded following bilateral vestibular damage, and improved when the canal VI was used. These results demonstrate that a canal VI can improve graviception in vestibulopathic animals, suggesting that it could reduce the disabling perceptual and postural deficits experienced by patients with severe vestibular damage. Patients with vestibular damage experience impaired vision, spatial perception, and balance, symptoms that could potentially respond to a vestibular implant (VI). Anatomic features facilitate semicircular canal (angular velocity) prosthetics but inhibit approaches with the otolith (linear acceleration) organs, and canal VIs that sense angular head velocity can generate compensatory eye velocity responses in vestibulopathic subjects. Can the brain use canal VI head velocity information to improve estimates of head orientation (e.g., head position relative to gravity), which is a prerequisite for accurate spatial perception and posture? Here we show that a canal VI can improve the perception of head orientation in vestibulopathic monkeys, results that are highly significant because they suggest that VIs mimicking canal function can improve spatial orientation and balance in vestibulopathic patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mice with chronic cochlear implants can significantly contribute to our understanding of the relationship between cochlear health and implant function because of the availability of molecular tools for controlling conditions in the cochlea and transgenic lines modeling human disease. To date, research in implanted mice has mainly consisted of short-term studies, but since there are large changes in implant function following implant insertion trauma, and subsequent recovery in many cases, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate function and perception under stable conditions. Because frequent anesthetic administration can be especially problematic in mice, a chronic model that can be tested in the awake condition is desirable. Electrically-evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) recorded with multichannel cochlear implants are useful functional measures because they can be obtained daily without anesthesia. In this study, we assessed changes and stability of ECAPs, electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs), ensemble spontaneous activity (ESA), and impedance data over time after implanting mice with multichannel implants. We then compared these data to histological findings in these implanted cochleae, and compared results from this chronic mouse model to data previously obtained in a well-established chronically-implanted guinea pig model. We determined that mice can be chronically implanted with cochlear implants, and ECAP recordings can be obtained frequently in an awake state for up to at least 42 days after implantation. These recordings can effectively monitor changes or stability in cochlear function over time. ECAP and EABR amplitude-growth functions (AGFs), AGF slopes, ESA levels and impedances in mice with multichannel implants appear similar to those found in guinea pigs with long-term multichannel implants. Animals with better survival of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and inner hair cells (IHCs) have steeper AGF slopes, and larger ESA responses. The time course of post-surgical ear recovery may be quicker in mice and can show different patterns of recovery which seem to be dependent on the degree of insertion trauma and subsequent histological conditions. Histology showed varying degrees of cochlear damage with fibrosis present in all implanted mouse ears and small amounts of new bone in a few ears. Impedance changes over time varied within and across animals and may represent changes over time in multiple variables in the cochlear environment post-implantation. Due to the small size of the mouse, susceptibility to stress, and the higher potential for implant failure, chronic implantation in mice can be challenging, but overall is feasible and useful for cochlear implant research.',\n",

PlasmaBlade is an innovative electrosurgical appliance harnessing pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy. Our aim was to assess the risk of damage to neuromodulation hardware during PlasmaBlade dissection. A simulated setting with chicken breast threaded with different hardware and PlasmaBlade used in three configurations. . Post dissection, the wires were inspected naked eye and under an operating microscope. The induced current was assessed contemporaneously using an oscilloscope. Five surgeons tested the PlasmaBlade at different generator settings. Sixty dissections were undertaken. No structural damage or induced current was identified at CUT 3/4, COAG 5. At CUT 6, COAG 5 and during dissection in a perpendicular orientation with prolonged hardware contact, opacification of insulation material occurred in 15/20 dissections. There was no dissolution of insulation even at this setting. On deviation from Medtronic advice, hardware damaged occurred if one was reckless with the PlasmaBlade. When using the recommended settings and operational technique, PlasmaBlade dissection did not cause any damage to implant wiring/tubing in this simulated setting. This report seeks to add to clinical data suggesting PlasmaBlade is safe for dissection around deep brain stimulator (DBS), vagal nerve stimulator (VNS), and spinal cord stimulator (SCS) hardware.

Different chitosan-based biomaterials have been employed in response to this necessity. We hypothesized that hydrogels made of antioxidant compounds functionalizing chitosan could provide a suitable environment to home new cells and offer a way to achieve brain repair. In this work, the implantation of functionalized chitosan biomaterials in a brain injury animal model was evaluated. The injury consisted of mechanical damage applied to the cerebral cortex of Wistar rats followed by the implantation of four different chitosan-based biomaterials. After 15 and 30\\xa0days, animals underwent magnetic resonance imaging, then they were sacrificed, and the brain tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The proliferation of microglia and astrocytes increased at the lesion zone, showing differences between the evaluated biomaterials. Also, cell nuclei were seen inside the biomaterials, indicating cell migration and biodegradation. Chitosan-based hydrogels are able to fill in the tissue cavity and bare cells for the endogenous restoration process. The addition of ferulic and succinic acid to the chitosan structure increases this capacity and decreases the inflammatory reaction to the implant.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Intracortical microelectrodes with the ability to detect intrinsic electrical signals and/or deliver electrical stimulation into local brain regions have been a powerful tool to understand brain circuitry and for therapeutic applications to neurological disorders. However, the chronic stability and sensitivity of these intracortical microelectrodes are challenged by overwhelming biological responses, including severe neuronal loss and thick glial encapsulation. Unlike microglia and astrocytes whose activity have been extensively examined, oligodendrocytes and their myelin processes remain poorly studied within the neural interface field. Oligodendrocytes have been widely recognized to modulate electrical signal conductance along axons through insulating myelin segments. Emerging evidence offers an alternative perspective on neuron-oligodendrocyte coupling where oligodendrocytes provide metabolic and neurotrophic support to neurons through cytoplasmic myelin channels and monocarboxylate transporters. This study uses in vivo multi-photon microscopy to gain insights into the dynamics of oligodendrocyte soma and myelin processes in response to chronic device implantation injury over 4 weeks. We observe that implantation induces acute oligodendrocyte injury including initial deformation and substantial myelinosome formation, an early sign of myelin injury. Over chronic implantation periods, myelin and oligodendrocyte soma suffer severe degeneration proximal to the interface. Interestingly, wound healing attempts such as oligodendrogenesis are initiated over time, however they are hampered by continued degeneration near the implant. Nevertheless, this detailed characterization of oligodendrocyte spatiotemporal dynamics during microelectrode-induced inflammation may provide insights for novel intervention targets to facilitate oligodendrogenesis, enhance the integration of neural-electrode interfaces, and improve long-term functional performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The preservation of residual hearing has become an important consideration in cochlear implant (CI) recipients in recent years. It was the aim of the present animal experimental study to investigate the influence of a pretreatment with near-infrared (NIR) light on preservation of sensory hair cells and residual hearing after cochlear implantation. NIR was applied unilaterally (15 min, 808 nm, 120 mW) to 8 guinea pigs, immediately before a bilateral scala tympani CI electrode insertion was performed. The nonirradiated (contralateral) side served as control. Twenty-eight days postoperatively, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were registered from both ears to screen for hearing loss. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) were counted and compared between NIR-pretreated and control (contralateral) cochleae. There was no IHC loss upon cochlear implantation. OHC loss was most prominent on both sides at the apical part of the cochlea. NIR pretreatment led to a statistically significant reduction in OHC loss (by 39.8%). ABR recordings (across the frequencies 4-32 kHz) showed a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups and corresponds well with the apical structural damage. Hearing loss was reduced by about 20 dB on average for the NIR-pretreated group (p ≤ 0.05). A single NIR pretreatment in this animal model of CI surgery appears to be neuroprotective for residual hearing. This is in line with other studies where several NIR posttreatments have protected cochlear and other neural tissues. NIR pretreatment is an inexpensive, effective, and noninvasive approach that can complement other ways of preserving residual hearing and, hence, should deserve further clinical evaluation in CI patients.

Patients with tinnitus, aged 18 to 35 years old, and with normal conventional PTA (125\\u200aHz-8\\u200akHz) were enrolled in the tinnitus group. Volunteers without tinnitus of the same age were enrolled in the control group. The incidence of EHF-HL and the hearing thresholds at each frequency, as well as the distribution of maximum HL frequency and edge frequency in all participants were compared. In total, 28 cases (43 ears) were enrolled in the tinnitus group and 34 cases (68 ears) in the control group. The incidence of EHF-HL, average hearing threshold of each frequency ranging from 4 to 16\\u200akHz, and the maximum hearing threshold were significantly higher in the tinnitus group. The edge frequency in the tinnitus group was lower than that in the control group (10.4\\u200a±\\u200a3.1\\u200akHz versus 12.3\\u200a±\\u200a2.5\\u200akHz, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.010).

The key enabling technology is the underlying use of carbon fiber electrodes, which are small, electrically conductive, and sensitive to dopamine. The carbon fibers were functionalized by coating with Parylene C, a thin insulator with a high dielectric constant, coupled with selective re-exposure of the carbon surface using laser ablation. We demonstrate the use of this technology by implanting 16 channel arrays in the rat nucleus accumbens. Chronic electrophysiology and dopamine signals were detected 1 month post implant. Additionally, electrodes were left in the tissue, sliced in place during histology, and showed minimal tissue damage.

       "  'abstract': 'Loss of sensory function is a common consequence of neurological injury. Recent clinical and preclinical evidence indicates vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with tactile rehabilitation, consisting of delivery of a variety of mechanical stimuli to the hyposensitive skin surface, yields substantial and long-lasting recovery of somatosensory function after median and ulnar nerve transection and repair. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific component of the tactile rehabilitation paired with VNS is necessary for recovery of somatosensory function. In a second experiment in a separate cohort, we investigated whether VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation could improve skilled forelimb motor function. Elements of the study design, including planned sample size, assessments, and statistical comparisons, were preregistered prior to beginning data collection (https://osf.io/3tm8u/). Animals received a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causing chronic sensory loss. Eight weeks after injury, animals were given a VNS implant followed by six weeks of tactile rehabilitation sessions consisting of repeated application of one of two distinct mechanical stimuli, a filament or a paintbrush, to the previously denervated forepaw. VNS paired with either filament indentation or brushing of the paw significantly improved recovery of forelimb withdrawal thresholds after PNI compared to tactile rehabilitation without VNS. The effect size was twice as large when VNS was paired with brushing compared to VNS paired with point indentation. An independent replication in a second cohort confirmed that VNS paired with brush restored forelimb withdrawal thresholds to normal. These rats displayed significant improvements in performance on a skilled forelimb task compared to rats that did not receive VNS. These findings support the utility of pairing VNS with tactile rehabilitation to improve recovery of somatosensory and motor function after neurological injury. Additionally, this study demonstrates that the sensory characteristics of the rehabilitation paired with VNS determine the degree of recovery.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Soft, stretchable materials hold great promise for the fabrication of biomedical devices due to their capacity to integrate gracefully with and conform to biological tissues. Conformal devices are of particular interest in the development of brain interfaces where rigid structures can lead to tissue damage and loss of signal quality over the lifetime of the implant. Interfaces to study brain function and dysfunction increasingly require multimodal access in order to facilitate measurement of diverse physiological signals that span the disparate temporal and spatial scales of brain dynamics. Here the Opto-e-Dura, a soft, stretchable, 16-channel electrocorticography array that is optically transparent is presented. Its compatibility with diverse optical and electrical readouts is demonstrated enabling multimodal studies that bridge spatial and temporal scales. The device is chronically stable for weeks, compatible with wide-field and 2-photon calcium imaging and permits the repeated insertion of penetrating multielectrode arrays. As the variety of sensors and effectors realizable on soft, stretchable substrates expands, similar devices that provide large-scale, multimodal access to the brain will continue to improve fundamental understanding of brain function.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Reduction of insertion injury is likely important to approach physiological conditions in the vicinity of implanted devices intended to interface with the surrounding brain. We have developed a novel, low-friction coating around frozen, gelatin embedded needles. By introducing a layer of thawing ice onto the gelatin, decreasing surface friction, we mitigate damage caused by the implantation. The acute effects of a transient stab on neuronal density and glial reactions were assessed 1 and 7 days post stab in rat cortex and striatum both within and outside the insertion track using immunohistochemical staining. The addition of a coat of melting ice to the frozen gelatin embedded needles reduced the insertion force with around 50 %, substantially reduced the loss neurons (i.e. reduced neuronal void), and yielded near normal levels of astrocytes within the insertion track 1 day after insertion, as compared to gelatin coated probes of the same temperature without ice coating. There were negligible effects on glial reactions and neuronal density immediately outside the insertion track of both ice coated and cold gelatin embedded needles. This new method of implantation presents a considerable improvement compared to existing modes of device insertion. Acute brain injuries following insertion of e.g. ultra-flexible electrodes, can be reduced by providing an outer coat of ultra-slippery thawing ice. No adverse effect of lowered implant temperature was found, opening the possibility of locking fragile electrode construct configurations in frozen gelatin, prior to implantation into the brain.

       "  'abstract': \"Bone-anchored hearing systems (BAHSs) are widely used for hearing rehabilitation and are indicated in cases of conductive and mixed hearing loss and in single-sided deafness. The Ponto system, that is one available option, has been on the market since 2009. The aim of this study is to systematically review the literature reporting on the Ponto system, with regard to audiological and surgical outcomes and patient's quality-of-life scores. A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database 2009-July 2019. Search term: ((osseointegrated hearing aid) OR (bone conduction implant) OR (bone anchored hearing) OR BAHA OR BAHS OR BAHI). Pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. English-language articles reporting original clinical data (audiological, surgical or quality-of-life outcomes) on the Ponto system were included. Articles reporting on Ponto and another BAHS system where the results on Ponto constituted less than 50% of the patient population or including only results on testband or softband devices were excluded. Audiological outcomes were discussed in 20 publications. Improvement against the unaided thresholds was demonstrated. The functional improvement was on average 33.9\\xa0dB. The effective gain or remaining air-bone gap was on average 6.7\\xa0dB. All evaluated data showed aided speech reception thresholds significantly below normal speech level. Twenty-seven publications reported surgical and follow-up data for the Ponto system. Implant survival was 97.7%, adverse skin reactions (Holgers\\xa0≥\\xa02) were 5% across visits and 15% across patients. No complications were life-threatening, causing permanent disability/damage or requiring a hospitalisation. Five studies reported quality of life using the Glasgow benefit inventory, 98% reported an improvement when analysing the score on an individual level. The outcomes of this systematic review confirm that percutaneous systems provide consistent audiological benefits and improved quality of life for patients. Further, the review demonstrates that the percutaneous systems are safe, with relatively low complication rates. Skin-related complications are the most common complication type and are experienced by approximately one patient out of seven, or in less than one of 20 follow-up visits. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the technical developments in neurosurgery, increasing numbers of neurosurgical implants are used in an increasingly aged population of patients with several comorbidities. Consequently, the number of neurosurgical implant-associated infections is continuously raising, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including disfiguring skull deformities and lack of brain protection. In this article we review infections associated with craniotomy, cranioplasty, neurostimulators, internal cerebrospinal fluid shunts, and external ventricular and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainages. In all implant-associated infections biofilms are involved, which are difficult to eradicate. A low number of microorganisms is sufficient to form a biofilm on the implant surface. In most infections, microorganisms of the skin flora are involved. Microorganisms reach the implant during surgery or immediately thereafter as a result of wound healing disturbances. In about two thirds of patients, implant-associated infections manifest early (within the first month after surgery), whereas the remaining infections present later as a result of low-grade infections or by direct extension from adjacent infections (per continuitatem) to the implants due to soft tissue damage. Except for ventriculo-atrial cerebrospinal fluid shunts, neurosurgical implants are rarely infected by the haematogenous route. In this article we review established and clinically validated concepts for the management of biofilm-associated infections in orthopaedic and trauma surgery, which can be extrapolated to other surgical disciplines that use implants. However, the evidence for the success of this extrapolation to neurosurgical patients is sparse and has not been evaluated in large patient populations. For favourable outcome, an optimised microbiological diagnosis including sonication of removed implants and prolonged incubation of cultures is required. Furthermore, a combined surgical and antimicrobial management strategy is needed. Surgery includes an appropriate debridement with or without implant exchange or removal, depending on the age of the biofilm and the soft tissue condition. Antimicrobial treatment includes a prolonged biofilm-active therapy, typically for 4&ndash;12 weeks. This concept is attractive, because in selected patients, implants can be retained or exchanged in a one-stage surgical procedure, which improves not only quality of life, but also decreases morbidity because every additional neurosurgical intervention can lead to secondary complications, including intracerebral bleeding or ischemia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious public health problem and can cause long-term damage to the brain, resulting in cognitive impairment in these patients. Insulin therapy for type 1 DM (DM1) can achieve overall blood glucose control, but glycemic variations can occur during injection intervals, which may contribute to some complications. Among the additional therapies available for DM1 treatment is the implantation of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) to attenuate hyperglycemia and even reverse diabetes. Here, we studied the strategy of implanting IPCs obtained from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from adipose tissue, comparing two different IPC implant sites, subcapsular renal (SR) and subcutaneous (SC), to investigate their putative protection against hippocampal damage, induced by STZ, in a rat DM1 model. Both implants improved hyperglycemia and reduced the serum content of advanced-glycated end products in diabetic rats, but serum insulin was not observed in the SC group. The SC-implanted group demonstrated ameliorated cognitive impairment (evaluated by novel object recognition) and modulation of hippocampal astroglial reactivity (evaluated by S100B and GFAP). Using GFP+\\xa0cell implants, the survival of cells at the implant sites was confirmed, as well as their migration to the pancreas and hippocampus. The presence of undifferentiated MSCs in our IPC preparation may explain the peripheral reduction in AGEs and subsequent cognitive impairment recovery, mediated by autophagic depuration and immunomodulation at the hippocampus, respectively. Together, these data reinforce the importance of MSCs for use in neuroprotective strategies, and highlight the logistic importance of the subcutaneous route for their administration.',\n",

Here, we present a new stereotaxic method that provides an alternative approach to a traditional u-frame stereotaxic device and reduces costs, surgical time, and aids repeatability. The RatHat brain implantation system is a 3D-printable stereotaxic device for rats that is fabricated prior to surgery and fits to the shape of the skull. RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for preventing damage from impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat in four different proof-of-principle experiments: (1) a three-pole cannula apparatus, (2) an optrode-electrode assembly, (3) a fixed-electrode array, and (4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to nine\\u2009months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in computer aided design (CAD) software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Severe damage to the organ of Corti leads to degeneration of the spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) which form the auditory nerve. This degeneration starts at the level of synaptic connection of the peripheral processes (PPs) of SGCs with the cochlear hair cells. It is generally thought that from this point SGC degeneration progresses in a retrograde fashion: PPs degenerate first, followed by the SGC soma with a delay of several weeks to many months. Evidence for this course of events, both in animals and in humans, is not unambiguous, while this knowledge is important since the presence or absence of the different neural elements may greatly influence the response to electrical stimulation with a cochlear implant (CI). We therefore aimed to provide a comprehensive account of the course of SGC degeneration in the guinea pig cochlea after ototoxic treatment. Histological analysis of eighteen healthy and thirty-three deafened cochleas showed that the degeneration of SGCs and their peripheral processes was simultaneous rather than sequential. As the site of excitation for electrical stimulation with a CI may depend on the course of degeneration of the various neural elements, this finding is relevant both for understanding the electrophysiological mechanisms behind cochlear implantation and for recent efforts to induce PP resprouting for improved electrode-neural interface. Since excitation of the PPs is often thought to result in (secondary) longer-latency activity, we tested the hypothesis that having relatively many PPs produces a larger N peak in the electrically evoked compound action potential (eCAP); the present findings however do not support this theory. The course of the degeneration process may vary among species, and may depend on the cause of deafness, but the present findings at least indicate that gradual retrograde degeneration of the auditory nerve is not an elemental process following severe damage to the organ of Corti.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An important challenge for the development of cortical visual prostheses is to generate spatially localized percepts of light, using artificial stimulation. Such percepts are called phosphenes, and the goal of prosthetic applications is to generate a pattern of phosphenes that matches the structure of the retinal image. A preliminary step in this process is to understand how the spatial positions of phosphene-like visual stimuli are encoded in the distributed activity of cortical neurons. The spatial resolution with which the distributed responses discriminate positions puts a limit on the capability of visual prosthesis devices to induce phosphenes at multiple positions. While most previous prosthetic devices have targeted the primary visual cortex, the extrastriate cortex has the advantage of covering a large part of the visual field with a smaller amount of cortical tissue, providing the possibility of a more compact implant. Here, we studied how well ensembles of Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and Multiunit activity (MUA) responses from extrastriate cortical visual area V4 of a behaving macaque monkey can discriminate between two-dimensional spatial positions. We used support vector machines (SVM) to determine the capabilities of LFPs and MUA to discriminate responses to phosphene-like stimuli (probes) at different spatial separations. We proposed a selection strategy based on the combined responses of multiple electrodes and used the linear learning weights to find the minimum number of electrodes for fine and coarse discriminations. We also measured the contribution of correlated trial-to-trial variability in the responses to the discrimination performance for MUA and LFP. We found that despite the large receptive field sizes in V4, the combined responses from multiple sites, whether MUA or LFP, are capable of fine and coarse discrimination of positions. Our electrode selection procedure significantly increased discrimination performance while reducing the required number of electrodes. Analysis of noise correlations in MUA and LFP responses showed that noise correlations in LFPs carry more information about spatial positions. This study determined the coding strategy for fine discrimination, suggesting that spatial positions could be well localized with patterned stimulation in extrastriate area V4. It also provides a novel approach to build a compact prosthesis with relatively few electrodes, which has the potential advantage of reducing tissue damage in real applications. ',\n",

Little is known about how individual neurotransmitter systems are differentially utilized in response to the ever-changing acoustic environment. Here we present quantitative evidence in rodents that the dopaminergic LOC input to ANFs is dynamically regulated according to the animal's recent acoustic experience. Sound exposure upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for dopamine synthesis, in cholinergic LOC intrinsic neurons, suggesting that individual LOC neurons might at times co-release ACh and DA. We further demonstrate that dopamine down-regulates ANF firing rates by reducing both the hair cell release rate and the size of synaptic events. Collectively, our results suggest that LOC intrinsic neurons can undergo on-demand neurotransmitter re-specification to re-calibrate ANF activity, adjust the gain at hair cell/ANF synapses, and possibly to protect these synapses from noise damage.\",\n",

Thus, there is great interest in discovering new targets or compounds that protect hair cells from these ototoxic drugs. Epigenetic regulation is closely related to inner ear development; however, little is known about epigenetic regulation in the process of ototoxic drugs-induced hearing loss. : In this study, we investigated the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) in aminoglycoside- and cisplatin-induced hair cell loss by using EPZ020411, a selective small molecule PRMT6 inhibitor,  in neonatal mouse cochlear explants and  in C57BL/6 mice. We also took advantage of the HEI-OC1 cell line to evaluate the anti-apoptosis effects of PRMT6 knockdown on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Apoptotic cells were identified using cleaved caspase-3 staining and TUNEL assay. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by DCFH-DA and cellROX green staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) were determined by JC-1, TMRM, and rhodamine 123 staining. : We found that EPZ020411 significantly alleviated neomycin- and cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis and increased hair cell survival. Moreover, pretreatment with EPZ020411 could attenuate neomycin- and cisplatin-induced hearing loss . Mechanistic studies revealed that inhibition of PRMT6 could reverse the increased expression of caspase-3 and cytochrome  translocation, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased accumulation of ROS, and activation of cell apoptosis after cisplatin injury. : Our findings suggested that PRMT6 might serve as a new therapeutic target to prevent hearing loss caused by aminoglycoside- and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity by preventing ROS formation and modulating the mitochondria-related damage and apoptosis.',\n",

Despite several implications, such as systemic toxicity and low efficacy, CT continues to be used for GB therapy. Aiming to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limitations, one of the most promising approaches is the use of drug delivery systems (DDS) to treat the cancer cells in situ. Dacarbazine (DTIC) is an antitumor agent that has limited application given its high toxicity to healthy cells. However, it is effective against GB recurrent cells. In this study, DTIC polymeric nanofibers (NF) were successfully prepared, characterized and its in vitro anticancer efficacy was determined. This system demonstrated high drug loading of 83.9 ± 6.5%, good stability and mechanical properties and sustained drug release, improved in tumor pH (6.8). This controlled release prolonged the uptake of GB improving DTIC antitumor effects such as DNA damage and cell death by apoptosis. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that DTIC interacts with PVA, possibly explaining the controlled release of the drug. Therefore, DTIC NF brain-implants show great potential as a promising drug delivery system for GB therapy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The sensorimotor cortex is a frequently targeted brain area for the development of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for communication in people with severe paralysis and communication problems (locked-in syndrome; LIS). It is widely acknowledged that this area displays an increase in high-frequency band (HFB) power and a decrease in the power of the low frequency band (LFB) during movement of, for example, the hand. Upon termination of hand movement, activity in the LFB band typically shows a short increase (rebound). The ability to modulate the neural signal in the sensorimotor cortex by imagining or attempting to move is crucial for the implementation of sensorimotor BCI in people who are unable to execute movements. This may not always be self-evident, since the most common causes of LIS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and brain stem stroke, are associated with significant damage to the brain, potentially affecting the generation of baseline neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and the modulation thereof by imagined or attempted hand movement. In the Utrecht NeuroProsthesis (UNP) study, a participant with LIS caused by ALS and a participant with LIS due to brain stem stroke were implanted with a fully implantable BCI, including subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes over the sensorimotor area, with the purpose of achieving ECoG-BCI-based communication. We noted differences between these participants in the spectral power changes generated by attempted movement of the hand. To better understand the nature and origin of these differences, we compared the baseline spectral features and task-induced modulation of the neural signal of the LIS participants, with those of a group of able-bodied people with epilepsy who received a subchronic implant with ECoG electrodes for diagnostic purposes. Our data show that baseline LFB oscillatory components and changes generated in the LFB power of the sensorimotor cortex by (attempted) hand movement differ between participants, despite consistent HFB responses in this area. We conclude that the etiology of LIS may have significant effects on the LFB spectral components in the sensorimotor cortex, which is relevant for the development of communication-BCIs for this population.',\n",

Several surgical techniques have been proposed but no surgeons have used the minimally assisted endoscope retrosigmoid approach for its removal. To investigate the feasibility of using a minimally invasive endoscope assisted retro-sigmoid approach for surgical removal of arachnoid cysts in the internal auditory canal. Minimally invasive endoscope assisted retrosigmoid approach allows to access to the internal auditory canal through a minimally invasive retrosigmoid approach that combines the use of a microscope and an endoscope. It is performed in six steps: soft tissue step, bone step, dura step, cerebellopontine angle step (performed using an endoscope and a microscope), microscope-endoscope assisted arachnoid cysts removal and closure. We tested minimally invasive endoscope assisted retrosigmoid approach for removal of arachnoid cysts in the internal auditory canal on two human cadaveric heads (specimens) of subjects affected from audio-vestibular disorders and with arachnoid cysts in the internal auditory canal confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The mass was completely and successfully removed from the two specimens with no damage to the nerves and/or vessels in the surgical area. The results of our study are encouraging and support the feasibility of using minimally invasive endoscope assisted retrosigmoid approach for removal of arachnoid cysts in the internal auditory canal. While further clinical in-vivo studies are needed to confirm the accuracy and safety of using the minimally invasive endoscope assisted retrosigmoid approach for this specific surgery, our group has successfully used the minimally invasive endoscope assisted retrosigmoid approach in the treatment of microvascular compressive syndrome, schwannoma removal and vestibular nerve resection.

Cochlear hair cell development and hearing function were normal in   mice, suggesting that Nfatc4 is not critical for cochlear development.

Finally, we demonstrated that Nfatc4-deficient hair cells showed lower sensitivity to damage induced by ototoxic drugs and noise exposure compared to wild type controls. The Tnf-mediated apoptosis pathway was attenuated in Nfatc4-deficient cochlear epithelium, and this might be the reason for the reduced sensitivity of Nfatc4-deficient hair cells to injury.

       "  'abstract': 'Evolving technologies and increasing understanding of human physiology over the past century have afforded our ability to intervene on human diseases using implantable bio-materials. These bio-electronic devices present a unique challenge through the creation of an interface between the native tissue and implantable bio-materials: the generation of host immune response surrounding such devices. While recent developments in cancer immunology seek to stimulate the immune system against cancer, successful long-term application of implantable bio-material devices need to durably minimize reactive immune processes at involved anatomical sites. Peripheral immune system response has been studied extensively for implanted bio-materials at various body sites. Examples include tooth composites (Gitalis et al., 2019), inguinal hernia repair (Heymann et al., 2019), and cardiac stents and pacemaker leads (Slee et al., 2016). Studies have also been extended to less well-studied immune reactivity in response to CNS neural-electronic implant devices. Recent technological advances in 2-Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy (2P-LSM) have allowed novel insights into  immune response in a variety of tissue microenvironments. While imaging of peripheral tissues has provided an abundance of data with regards to immune cell dynamics, central nervous system (CNS) imaging is comparatively complicated by tissue accessibility and manipulation. Despite these challenges, the results of dynamic intravital neuro-immune imaging thus far have provided foundational insights into basic CNS biology. Utilizing a combination of intravital and  2P-LSM, we have observed novel pathways allowing immune cells, stromal cells, cancer cells and proteins to communicate between the CNS parenchyma and peripheral vasculature. Similar to what has been reported in the intestinal tract, we have visualized myeloid cells extend dendritic processes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) into pial blood vessels. Furthermore, transient vessel leaks seen during systemic inflammation provide opportunities for cellular protein to be exchanged between the periphery and CNS. These insights provide new, visual information regarding immune surveillance and antigen presentation within the CNS. Furthermore, when combining intravital 2P-LSM and microfluidic devices complexed with mathematical modeling, we are gaining new insights into the intravascular behavior of circulating immune cells. This new knowledge into the basic mechanisms by which cells migrate to and interact with the CNS provide important considerations for the design of neuro-electronic biomaterials that have the potential to connect the peripheral-neural microenvironments into a unique, artificial interface.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Electrode arrays for chronic implantation in the brain are a critical technology in both neuroscience and medicine. Recently, flexible, thin-film polymer electrode arrays have shown promise in facilitating stable, single-unit recordings spanning months in rats. While array flexibility enhances integration with neural tissue, it also requires removal of the dura mater, the tough membrane surrounding the brain, and temporary bracing to penetrate the brain parenchyma. Durotomy increases brain swelling, vascular damage, and surgical time. Insertion using a bracing shuttle results in additional vascular damage and brain compression, which increase with device diameter; while a higher-diameter shuttle will have a higher critical load and more likely penetrate dura, it will damage more brain parenchyma and vasculature. One way to penetrate the intact dura and limit tissue compression without increasing shuttle diameter is to reduce the force required for insertion by sharpening the shuttle tip. We describe a novel design and fabrication process to create silicon insertion shuttles that are sharp in three dimensions and can penetrate rat dura, for faster, easier, and less damaging implantation of polymer arrays. Sharpened profiles are obtained by reflowing patterned photoresist, then transferring its sloped profile to silicon with dry etches. We demonstrate that sharpened shuttles can reliably implant polymer probes through dura to yield high quality single unit and local field potential recordings for at least 95 days. On insertion directly through dura, tissue compression is minimal. This is the first demonstration of a rat dural-penetrating array for chronic recording. This device obviates the need for a durotomy, reducing surgical time and risk of damage to the blood-brain barrier. This is an improvement to state-of-the-art flexible polymer electrode arrays that facilitates their implantation, particularly in multi-site recording experiments. This sharpening process can also be integrated into silicon electrode array fabrication. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tinnitus may have a very severe impact on the quality of life. Unfortunately, for many patients, a satisfactory treatment modality is lacking. The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) was originally indicated for hearing restoration in patients with non-functional cochlear nerves, for example, in neurofibromatosis type II. In analogy to a cochlear implant (CI), it has been demonstrated that an ABI may reduce tinnitus as a beneficial side effect. For tinnitus treatment, an ABI may have an advantage over a CI, as cochlear implantation can harm inner ear structures due to its invasiveness, while an ABI is presumed to not damage anatomical structures. This is the first study to implant an ABI to investigate its effect on intractable tinnitus. In this pilot study, 10 adults having incapacitating unilateral intractable tinnitus and ipsilateral severe hearing loss will have an ABI implanted. The ABI is switched on 6 weeks after implantation, followed by several fitting sessions aimed at finding an optimal stimulation strategy. The primary outcome will be the change in Tinnitus Functioning Index. Secondary outcomes will be tinnitus burden and quality of life (using Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires), tinnitus characteristics (using Visual Analogue Scale, a tinnitus analysis), safety, audiometric and vestibular function. The end point is set at 1\\u2009year after implantation. Follow-up will continue until 5\\u2009years after implantation. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Centre Groningen, The Netherlands (METc 2015/479). The trial is registered at www.clinicialtrials.gov and will be updated if amendments are made. Results of this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific conferences.

       "  'abstract': 'To date, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) research in large animal models has been limited. Recent advances in neocortical microscopy have made possible new insights into neocortical PTE. However, it is very difficult to engender convincing neocortical PTE in rodents. Thus, large animal models that develop neocortical PTE may provide useful insights that also can be more comparable to human patients. Because gyrencephalic species have prolonged latent periods, long-term video EEG recording is required. Here, we report a fully subcutaneous EEG implant with synchronized video in freely ambulatory swine for up to 13 months during epileptogenesis following bilateral cortical impact injuries or sham surgery The advantages of this system include the availability of a commercially available system that is simple to install, a low failure rate after surgery for EEG implantation, radiotelemetry that enables continuous monitoring of freely ambulating animals, excellent synchronization to video to EEG, and a robust signal to noise ratio. The disadvantages of this system in this species and age are the accretion of skull bone which entirely embedded a subset of skull screws and EEG electrodes, and the inability to rearrange the EEG electrode array. These disadvantages may be overcome by splicing a subdural electrode strip to the electrode leads so that skull growth is less likely to interfere with long-term signal capture and by placing two implants for a more extensive montage. This commercially available system in this bilateral cortical impact swine model may be useful to a wide range of investigators studying epileptogenesis in PTE.Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a cause of significant morbidity after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is often drug-resistant. Robust, informative animal models would greatly facilitate PTE research. Ideally, this biofidelic model of PTE would utilize a species that approximates human brain anatomy, brain size, glial populations, and inflammatory pathways. An ideal model would also incorporate feasible methods for long-term video EEG recording required to quantify seizure activity. Here, we describe the first model of PTE in swine and describe a method for robust long-term video EEG monitoring for up to 13 months post-TBI. The relatively easy \"out-of-the-box\" radiotelemetry system and surgical techniques described here will be adaptable by a wide array of investigators studying the pathogenesis and treatment of PTE.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Genistein possesses estrogenic activity and has been considered a potential replacement for estrogen replacement therapy after menopause. In the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of dietary genistein at varied lengths of estrogen deprivation in middle-aged ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats under ischemic conditions. Two weeks of treatment with dietary genistein at 42\\xa0mg/kg but not 17β-estradiol implants improved cognitive flexibility (Morris water maze test) after short-term estrogen deprivation (2\\xa0weeks) but not long-term estrogen deprivation (12\\xa0weeks). 17β-estradiol implants but not dietary genistein improved locomotor asymmetry (cylinder test) after long-term but not short-term estrogen deprivation. Dietary genistein but not 17β-estradiol implant improved early phase motor learning (rotarod test) after long-term estrogen deprivation. Neither 17β-estradiol implant nor dietary genistein reduced infarct size after either short-term or long-term estrogen deprivation. Genistein, however, reduced ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba1) expression, a marker of brain inflammation, at the ipsilateral side of stroke injury after short-term but not long-term estrogen deprivation. This study suggests that the neuroprotective effects of dietary genistein on motor and cognitive functions are distinctly influenced by the length of estrogen deprivation following focal ischemia. SIGNIFICANCE: There is an increasing postmenopausal population opting for homeopathic medicines for the management of menopausal symptoms due to the perceived distrust in estrogen use as hormone replacement. Basic and clinical studies support the notion that early, but not delayed, hormone replacement after menopause is beneficial. Furthermore, evidence suggests that delaying hormone replacement augments the detrimental, rather than the beneficial effects of estrogens. Because of the active consideration of soy isoflavones including genistein as alternatives to estrogen replacement, it is necessary to understand the ramifications of soy isoflavones use when their administration is begun at various times after menopause.',\n",

Customized alloplastic cranioplasty using 3D-printed prefabricated mold for casting PMMA implant is easy to perform technique for the restoration of cranial vault after a decompressive craniectomy following moderate-to-severe TBI. It is a valuable and modern technique to advance manufacturing of personalized prefabricated cranioplastic implants used for the reconstruction of large skull defects having complex geometry.

       "  'abstract': 'Nerve injury requiring surgical repair often results in poor functional recovery due to the inability of host axons to re-grow long distances and reform meaningful connections with the target muscle. While surgeons can re-route local axon fascicles to the target muscle, there are no technologies to provide an exogenous source of axons without sacrificing healthy nerves. Accordingly, we have developed tissue engineered neuromuscular interfaces (TE-NMIs) as the first injectable microtissue containing motor and sensory neurons in an anatomically-inspired architecture. TE-NMIs provide axon tracts that are intended to integrate with denervated distal structures and preserve regenerative capacity during prolonged periods without host innervation. Following implant, we found that TE-NMI axons promoted Schwann cell maintenance, integrated with distal muscle, and preserved an evoked muscle response out to 20-weeks post nerve transection in absence of innervation from host axons. By repopulating the distal sheath with exogenous axons, TE-NMIs also enabled putative delayed fusion with proximal host axons, a phenomenon previously not achievable in delayed repair scenarios due to distal axon degeneration. Here, we found immediate electrophysiological recovery after fusion with proximal host axons and improved axon maturation and muscle reinnervation at 24-weeks post-transection (4-weeks following delayed nerve fusion). These findings show that TE-NMIs provide the potential to improve functional recovery following delayed nerve repair.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"At present, lots of studies have discussed the effects and outcomes of cranioplasty using polyetheretherketone (PEEK). However, interventions or management for PEEK cranioplasty got less attention. This article presented a perioperative paradigm for preventing postoperative complications. Modified PEEK plates with certified safety were implanted in patients who received evolving perioperative paradigm. Serial perioperative managements were developed as a comprehensive paradigm to prevent correlated risk factors of postoperative complications, which mainly included managements of epidural collections and wound healing. The preparation of the surgical area and systemic state were essential before surgery. During the operation, the blood supply of the incision and the handling of dura and temporalis were highlighted in our paradigm. After cranioplasty, management of subcutaneous drainage and wound healing were stressed. Patients received conventional management from February 2017 to August 2018 in our center. After the evolving paradigm developed, patients received comprehensive perioperative management from September 2018 to August 2020. A total of 104 patients who underwent PEEK cranioplasty were consecutively enrolled; 38 (36.5%) received conventional perioperative management, and 66 (63.5%) received evolving perioperative paradigm. The general information of the two groups was comparable. Notably, patients who received the evolving paradigm presented a significantly decreased incidence of postoperative complications from 47.4 to 18.2% ( < 0.01), among which the incidences of subcutaneous effusion, epidural hematoma, and subcutaneous infection decreased significantly. The evolving perioperative paradigm could effectively prevent risk factors and reduce related complications. It was valuable to promote these comprehensive managements and inspire more clinical practice on improving patients' outcomes after PEEK cranioplasty. \",\n",

Current guidelines suggest that all PTB fractures should be screened for blunt cerebrovascular injury, however clinical practice varies. The purpose of this study was to identify features associated with PTB fractures that increase the likelihood of ICA injury. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients with PTB fractures who were investigated with computed-tomography angiography (CTA) scan admitted to a Level One Trauma Service in Melbourne, Australia from 2015-2020. Patient demographic and injury data were obtained from The Royal Melbourne Hospital Trauma Registry and medical records. Multivariate binomial logistic regression was performed to identify features associated with ICA injury. Out of 377 patients with 419 PTB fractures, 205 received a CTA scan and were included, identifying 22 ICA injuries (9.4%). The median age of ICA injuries was 33 (IQR 23-61), median Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score for the head region was 5 (IQR 5-5) and the in-hospital mortality rate was 45.5%, mainly due to unsurvivable brain injury. Five patients (22.7%) developed ICA-specific complications of stroke or carotid-cavernous fistula. We identified five factors that were significantly associated with ICA injury. These included PTB fractures involving the carotid canal (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.9-23.9, p=0.003), presenting with an initial GCS less than nine (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.2-26.5, p=0.025) and increasing head AIS (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6, p=0.009). Mechanisms of injury that were associated with ICA injury were motor vehicle crash (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.4-14.2, p=0.012) and motorbike crash (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.2-18, p=0.029). Patients with PTB fractures and an additional feature of carotid canal involvement, presenting GCS less than nine, increasing head AIS indicative of severe head trauma or mechanism of injury by motor vehicle or motorbike crash, are at an increased risk of ICA injury and should be screened with a CTA scan.

       "  'abstract': \"Cranioplasty with freehand-molded polymethylmethacrylate implants is based on decades of experience and is still frequently used in clinical practice. However, data confirming the fracture toughness and standard biomechanical tests are rare. This study aimed to determine the amount of force that could be applied to virtually planned, template-molded, patient-specific implants ( = 10) with an implant thickness of 3 mm, used in the treatment of a temporoparietal skull defect (91.87 cm), until the implant cracks and finally breaks. Furthermore, the influence of the weight and porosity of the implant on its force resistance was investigated. The primary outcome showed that a high force was required to break the implant (mean and standard deviation 1484.6 ± 167.7 N), and this was very strongly correlated with implant weight (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.97;  &lt; 0.001). Secondary outcomes were force application at the implant's first, second, and third crack. Only a moderate correlation could be found between fracture force and the volume of porosities (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.59;  = 0.073). The present study demonstrates that an implant thickness of 3 mm for a temporoparietal skull defect can withstand sufficient force to protect the brain. Greater implant weight and, thus, higher material content increases thickness, resulting in more resistance. Porosities that occur during the described workflow do not seem to reduce resistance. Therefore, precise knowledge of the fracture force of polymethylmethacrylate cranial implants provides insight into brain injury prevention and serves as a reference for the virtual design process.\",\n",

To present an initial case series for patients undergoing awake DBS with the Mazor Renaissance Guidance System and evaluate operative variables and stereotactic accuracy. Retrospective data collection at a single institution was conducted for an initial 35 consecutive patients. Patient demographics and operative variables, including case times, microelectrode recording passes, and postoperative complications, were obtained by chart review. Implant accuracy was evaluated through measuring radial and vector (x, y) errors using the Mazor software. Pneumocephalus volumes were calculated using immediate postoperative T1-weighted MRI scans. Total operating room (245 ± 5.5 min) and procedural (179 ± 4.7) times were comparable with previous awake DBS literature. The radial error for center tract implants was 1.3 ± 0.1 mm, with smaller error in the first (1.1 ± 0.2) vs second (1.7 ± 0.3) implants of bilateral DBS (P = .048). Vector error analysis demonstrated larger shifts posteriorly for first implants and medially for second implants. Pneumocephalus volumes (12.4 ± 2.2 cm3) were not associated with increased microelectrode recording passes, radial error, or complications.

Our results showed that for stiff implants, the strain magnitude is dependent on the magnitude of the motion, where a micromotion increase from 1 to 10 μm induced an increase in the strain by an order of magnitude. For higher displacement over 10 μm, the change in the strain was relatively smaller. We also showed that displacement magnitude has no impact on the location of maximum strain and addressed the conflicting results in the literature. Further, we explored the effect of different probe materials [i.e., silicon, polyimide (PI), and polyvinyl acetate nanocomposite (PVAc-NC)] on the magnitude, location, and distribution of strain. Finally, we showed that strain distribution across cortical implants was in line with published results on the size of the typical glial response to the neural probe, further reaffirming that strain can be a precursor to the glial response.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is effective in controlling increasing intracranial pressure determined by a wide range of conditions, mainly traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, and the subsequent cranioplasty (CP) displays potential therapeutic benefit in terms of overall neurological function. While autologous bone flap (ABF) harvested at the time of DC is the ideal material for skull defect reconstruction, it carries several risks. Aseptic bone flap resorption (BFR) is one of the most common complications, often leading to surgical failure. The aim of our study was to systematically review the literature and carry out a meta-analysis of possible factors involved in BFR in patients undergoing ABF cranioplasty after DC. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Different medical databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus) were screened for eligible scientific reports until April 30th 2021. The following data were collected for meta-analysis to assess their role in BFR: sex, age, the interval time between DC and CP, the presence of systemic factors, the etiology determining the DC, CP surgical time, CP features, VP shunt placement, CP infection. Studies including pediatric patients or with less than 50 patients were excluded. Fifteen studies were included. There was a statistically significant increased incidence of BFR in patients with CPF\\u2009>\\u20092 compared to patients with CPF\\u2009≤\\u20092 (54.50% and 22.76% respectively, p\\u2009=\\u20090.010). TBI was a significantly more frequent etiology in the BFR group compared to patients without BFR (61.95% and 47.58% respectively, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Finally, patients with BFR were significantly younger than patients without BFR (39.12\\u2009±\\u200915.36\\xa0years and 47.31\\u2009±\\u200914.78\\xa0years, respectively, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The funnel plots were largely symmetrical for all the studied factors. Bone flap fragmentation, TBI etiology, and young age significantly increase the risk of bone resorption. Further studies are needed to strengthen our results and to clarify if, in those cases, a synthetic implant for primary CP should be recommended.',\n",

Results from  experiments showed that either tyramine-modified hyaluronic acid hydrogels (HT) or NGF loaded HT hydrogels (HT/NGF) possessed good biocompatibility. More importantly, the HT hydrogels loaded with BMSC and NGF could facilitate the survival and proliferation of endogenous neural cells probably by neurotrophic factors release and neuroinflammation regulation, and consequently improved the neurological function recovery and accelerated the repair process in a C57BL/6 TBI mice model. All these findings highlight that this injectable, BMSC and NGF-laden HT hydrogel has enormous potential for TBI and other tissue repair therapy.',\n",

By transiently implanting oxygen microsensors into rat cortex cerebri for 2\\xa0h, substantial and long lasting (>1\\xa0h) hypoxia is routinely generated in surrounding tissues; this hypoxia is linked to implantation generated compressive forces. Preferential loss of larger neurons and reduced metabolic components in surviving neurons indicates decreased viability one week after such hypoxic, compressive implantations. By devising an implantation method that relaxes compressive forces; magnitude and duration of hypoxia generated following such an implantation are ameliorated and neurons appear similar to naïve tissues. In line with these observations, astrocyte proliferation was significantly more pronounced for more hypoxic, compressive implantations. Surprisingly, astrocyte processes were frequently found to traverse cellular boundaries into nearby neuronal nuclei, indicating injury induction of a previously not described astrocyte-neuron interaction. Found more frequently in less hypoxic, force-relaxed insertions and thus correlating to a more beneficial outcome, this finding may suggest a novel protective mechanism. In conclusion, substantial and long lasting insertion induced hypoxia around brain implants, a previously overlooked factor, is linked to significant adverse alterations in nervous tissue.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite the high incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is no universal treatment to safely treat patients. Blunt brain injuries destroy primary neural tissue that results in impaired perfusion, excessive release of glutamate, inflammation, excitotoxicity, and progressive secondary neuronal cell death. We hypothesized that administration of cannabidiol (CBD) directly to a brain contusion site, will optimize delivery to the injured tissue which will reduce local neural excitation and inflammation to spare neural tissue and improve neurological outcome following TBI. CBD was infused into a gelfoam matrix forming an implant (CBDi), then applied over the dura at the contusion site as well as delivered systemically by injection (CBD.IP). Post-injury administration of CBDi+IP greatly reduced defecation scores, lesion volume, the loss of neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus, the number of injured neurons of the contralateral hippocampus, and reversed TBI-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) upregulation which was superior to either CBD.IP or CBDi treatment alone. Vestibulomotor performance on the beam-balance test was restored by 12\\xa0days post-TBI and sustained through 28\\xa0days. CBDi+IP treated rats exhibited preinjury levels of spontaneous alternation on the spontaneous alternation T-maze. In the object recognition test, they had greater mobility and exploration of novel objects compared to contusion or implant alone consistent with reduced anxiety and restored cognitive function. These results suggest that dual therapy by targeting the site of injury internally with a CBD-infused medical carrier followed by systemic supplementation may offer a more effective countermeasure than systemic or implant treatment alone for the deleterious effects of penetrating head wounds.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The evaluation of the long-term stability of ElectroCorticoGram (ECoG) signals is an important scientific question as new implantable recording devices can be used for medical purposes such as Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) or brain monitoring.The long-term clinical validation of wireless implantable multi-channel acquisition system for generic interface with neurons (WIMAGINE), a wireless 64-channel epidural ECoG recorder was investigated. The WIMAGINE device was implanted in two quadriplegic patients within the context of a BCI protocol. This study focused on the ECoG signal stability in two patients bilaterally implanted in June 2017 (P1) and in November 2019 (P2).. The ECoG signal was recorded at rest prior to each BCI session resulting in a 32 month and in a 14 month follow-up for P1 and P2 respectively. State-of-the-art signal evaluation metrics such as root mean square (RMS), the band power (BP), the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the effective bandwidth (EBW) and the spectral edge frequency (SEF) were used to evaluate stability of signal over the implantation time course. The time-frequency maps obtained from task-related motor activations were also studied to investigate the long-term selectivity of the electrodes.Based on temporal linear regressions, we report a limited decrease of the signal average level (RMS), spectral distribution (BP) and SNR, and a remarkable steadiness of the EBW and SEF. Time-frequency maps obtained during motor imagery, showed a high level of discrimination 1 month after surgery and also after 2 years.The WIMAGINE epidural device showed high stability over time. The signal evaluation metrics of two quadriplegic patients during 32 months and 14 months respectively provide strong evidence that this wireless implant is well-suited for long-term ECoG recording.These findings are relevant for the future of implantable BCIs, and could benefit other patients with spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuromuscular diseases or drug-resistant epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Novel neural stimulation protocols mimicking biological signals and patterns have demonstrated significant advantages as compared to traditional protocols based on uniform periodic square pulses. At the same time, the treatments for neural disorders which employ such protocols require the stimulator to be integrated into miniaturized wearable devices or implantable neural prostheses. Unfortunately, most miniaturized stimulator designs show none or very limited ability to deliver biomimetic protocols due to the architecture of their control logic, which generates the waveform. Most such designs are integrated into a single System-on-Chip (SoC) for the size reduction and the option to implement them as neural implants. But their on-chip stimulation controllers are fixed and limited in memory and computing power, preventing them from accommodating the amplitude and timing variances, and the waveform data parameters necessary to output biomimetic stimulation. To that end, a new stimulator architecture is proposed, which distributes the control logic over three component tiers - software, microcontroller firmware and digital circuits of the SoC, which is compatible with existing and future biomimetic protocols and with integration into implantable neural prosthetics. A portable prototype with the proposed architecture is designed and demonstrated in a bench-top test with various known biomimetic output waveforms. The prototype is also tested  to deliver a complex, continuous biomimetic stimulation to a rat model of a spinal-cord injury. By delivering this unique biomimetic stimulation, the device is shown to successfully reestablish the connectivity of the spinal cord post-injury and thus restore motor outputs in the rat model.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cathepsin H (CatH) is a lysosomal cysteine protease with a unique aminopeptidase activity. Its expression level is increased in activated immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and microglia. We have previously reported that CatH deficiency impairs toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and the subsequent secretion of interferon (IFN)-β from dendritic cells. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that IFN-β secreted from microglia/macrophages has neuroprotective effects. These observations prompted further investigation into the effects of CatH deficiency on neuropathological changes. In this study, neuropathological changes were examined using histochemical staining (both hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Nissl) of the hippocampus of wild-type (WT) and CatH-deficient (CatH) mice after hypoxia-ischemia (HI). The density and the localization of CatH and TLR3 were examined by immunofluorescent staining. CatH processing in microglia was assayed by pulse-chase experiments, while immunoblotting was used to examine TLR3 expression and IRF3 activation in microglia/macrophages in the presence of poly(I:C). Microglial cell death was examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and primary astrocyte proliferation in the presence of IFN-β was examined using scratch wound assay. WT mice displayed severe atrophy in association with neuronal death and moderate astrogliosis in the hippocampus following neonatal HI. Somewhat surprisingly, CatH mice showed marked neuronal death without severe atrophy in the hippocampus following HI. Furthermore, there was notable microglia/macrophages cell death and strong astrogliosis in the hippocampus. The TLR3 and phosphorylated IRF3 expression level in the hippocampus or splenocytes (mainly splenic macrophages); from CatH mice was lower than in WT mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that recombinant IFN-β suppressed HI-induced microglial cell death and astrocyte proliferation. These observations suggest that CatH plays a critical role in the proteolytic maturation and stabilization of TLR3, which is necessary for IFN-β production. Therefore, impaired TLR3/IFN-β signaling resulting from CatH deficiency may induce microglial cell death after activation and astrogliosis/glial scar formation in the hippocampus following HI injury, leading to suppression of hippocampal atrophy.

Revision rate was 131/684 (19%; 95% CI 13-25; 10 studies) in autografts, 61/317 (18%; 95%CI 9-28; 7 studies) in hPMMA, 84/599 (13%; 95% CI 7-19; 11 studies) in Ti, 7/59 (9%; 95% CI 1-23; 3 studies) in pPMMA, and 25/216 (12%; 95% CI 4-24; 4 studies) in HA. Infection occurred in 463/4667 (8%; 95% CI 6-11) and implant exposure in 120/1651 (6%; 95% CI 4-9). PEEK appears to have the lowest risk of cranioplasty revision, but further research is required to determine the optimal material. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Loss of hair cells (HCs) accounts for most sensorineural hearing loss, and regeneration of cochlear HCs is considered as the ultimate strategy for restoring hearing. Several lines of evidence have shown that Lgr5+ progenitor cells can spontaneously regenerate new HCs after HC loss at the neonatal stage, and most of which are immature. IHCs are resistant to ototoxic drugs and noise and cannot be ablated efficiently in order to precisely investigate IHC regeneration in existing hearing injury models, and thus we generated a new transgenic mouse model by inserting diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the control of the Vglut3 promoter. In this model, IHCs were selectively ablated in a dose-dependent manner after the injection of diphtheria toxin (DT) at the neonatal stage, while OHCs remained intact with normal hair bundle structures until adulthood. With this IHC-specific injury model, we observed HC regeneration from Lgr5+ progenitors after IHC ablation at the neonatal stage. Some of the newly generated HCs replaced the lost IHCs in-situ and re-build the structure of the organ of Corti through the asymmetrical mitosis of progenitor cells. While, the majority of the regenerated HCs did not survive until adulthood, and the loss of spiral ganglion neurons was observed after the IHC ablation, which led to profound hearing loss after DT injection in Vglut3 mice at the neonatal stage. The model presented here shows promise for investigating the mechanisms behind IHC loss and subsequent regeneration.',\n",

The most common complications are catheter-related complications (CRCs) including kinking/occlusion, blockage, migration, fracture, disconnection, and CSF leak. Our objective was to determine the CRC rate in a large cohort of adults with newly implanted ITB pump systems with polymer reinforced silicone catheters. This is a retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database consisting of patients who had undergone implantation of ITB pump systems with Ascenda (Medtronic, Minneapolis) catheters from 2013 to 2020. Over this seven-year period, 141 patients underwent ITB pump system implantations; 126 of which had a minimum of one-year follow-up. The 126 patients with a minimum of one year follow-up (average 43 month; range 12-89), had an average age of 51\\u2009years (63% male). Severe spasticity was due to spinal cord injury (38%), traumatic brain injury (15%), cerebral palsy (13%), multiple sclerosis (11%), stroke (10%), and other (13%). Nine (7.1%) CRCs occurred in 7 (5.6%) patients (median 6 mo. post-implant): 5 intrathecal catheter occlusions (range 3-52 months post-implant), two fractures in one patient (6 months), one disconnection at the catheter pump interface (2 months), and one due to kinking at 84 months No migrations occurred. Reported CRCs have been high for ITB pump systems. Ours is the first large cohort, long-term study of CRCs related to reinforced catheters; additionally, our low CRC rate compares favorably to previously published data. Thus, implantation of reinforced catheters may be associated with a low CRC rate. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study was aimed to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) would increase the secretion of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) from injured spinal cord tissue, and, if so, whether the increased NT-3 would promote the survival, differentiation, and migration of grafted tyrosine kinase C (TrkC)-modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived neural network cells. We next sought to determine if the latter would integrate with the host spinal cord neural circuit to improve the neurological function of injured spinal cord. After NT-3-modified Schwann cells (SCs) and TrkC-modified MSCs were co-cultured in a gelatin sponge scaffold for 14\\xa0days, the MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells that formed a MSC-derived neural network (MN) implant. On this basis, we combined the MN implantation with EA in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and performed immunohistochemical staining, neural tracing, electrophysiology, and behavioral testing after 8\\xa0weeks. Electroacupuncture application enhanced the production of endogenous NT-3 in damaged spinal cord tissues. The increase in local NT-3 production promoted the survival, migration, and maintenance of the grafted MN, which expressed NT-3 high-affinity TrkC. The combination of MN implantation and EA application improved cortical motor-evoked potential relay and facilitated the locomotor performance of the paralyzed hindlimb compared with those of controls. These results suggest that the MN was better integrated into the host spinal cord neural network after EA treatment compared with control treatment. Electroacupuncture as an adjuvant therapy for TrkC-modified MSC-derived MN, acted by increasing the local production of NT-3, which accelerated neural network reconstruction and restoration of spinal cord function following SCI.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that mitochondria play a key role in axon degeneration and regeneration under physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs at an early stage of axon degeneration and involves oxidative stress, energy deficiency, imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics, defects in mitochondrial transport, and mitophagy dysregulation. The restoration of these defective mitochondria by enhancing mitochondrial transport, clearance of reactive oxidative species (ROS), and improving bioenergetic can greatly contribute to axon regeneration. In this paper, we focus on the biological behavior of axonal mitochondria in aging, injury (e.g., traumatic brain and spinal cord injury), and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, AD; Parkinson's disease, PD; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS) and consider the role of mitochondria in axon regeneration. We also compare the behavior of mitochondria in different diseases and outline novel therapeutic strategies for addressing abnormal mitochondrial biological behavior to promote axonal regeneration in neurological diseases and injuries.\",\n",

Through an international collaboration, our team in Da Nang, Vietnam is able to create low-cost, customized titanium implants for patients with skull defects. We discuss the details of our collaboration and present our experience with this procedure. We conducted a retrospective review of 35 patients who underwent cranioplasty using custom-made titanium implants. The molding and implant making processes were performed by our neurosurgeons using a 3D printer donated by the United Kingdom-based nongovernmental organization Facing the World. We obtained demographic and preoperative data (reason for skull defect, location, surface area measurement of defect) and postoperative data (complications, cosmetic outcome, and patient satisfaction). The median patient age was 27 years (range, 16-60 years). Primary indications for craniectomy included traumatic brain injury from motor vehicle accident (77.1%), cerebrovascular disease (11.4%), implant failure following previous cranioplasty (5.7%), and fall (5.7%). Postoperatively, all implants were found to have an excellent fit; at 6-month follow-up, none of the implants required removal. Complications included 4 postoperative hematomas and 1 surgical site infection. All the patients had improved aesthetic appearance and high satisfaction. Cranioplasty using customized titanium implants yields excellent results for patients with skull defects, demonstrating the practicality of this technique for cranioplasty in low-income countries. Our experience highlights the importance of ongoing international collaboration to improve neurosurgical care in these countries. ',\n",

However, little attention has been given to the evaluation of the design of ceramic-titanium (CeTi) implants. A biomechanical evaluation of 3 patient-specific cranial implants was performed using finite element analysis. The results of the analyses allowed the identification of the implant regions as well as the magnitudes of the maximum stresses on, and displacements along, these regions after traumatic impact. The analyses also showed that polyether ether ketone cranial implants offer inferior brain and neurocranial protection due to their high flexibility and local peak stresses at the bone-screw interface. In contrast, CeTi implants were able to evenly distribute the stresses along the interface and thus reduced the risk of neurocranial fracture. The scaffold structure at the border of these implants reduced stress shielding and enhanced bone ingrowth. Moreover, brain injuries were less likely to occur, as the CeTi implant exhibits limited deflection. From the finite element analyses, CeTi cranial implants appear less likely to induce calvarial fractures with a better potential to protect the brain under impact loads. ',\n",

Elevation of proinflammatory cytokines following intra-articular fracture may lead to synovial catabolism and cartilage degradation. We aimed to compare cytokine levels in injured and healthy ankle joints, examine the longer-term cytokine levels in fractured ankles, and investigate the association between cytokine levels in fractured ankles and plasma. In this cross-sectional study, synovial fluid (SF) and plasma of forty-seven patients with acute intra-articular ankle fractures and eight patients undergoing implant removal were collected prior to surgery. We determined concentrations of sixteen inflammatory cytokines, two cartilage degradation proteins, and four metabolic proteins and compared the levels in acutely injured ankles with those of the healthy contralateral side or during metal removal. Cytokine levels in injured ankles were also compared to serum cytokine levels. Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum and Spearman tests were used for statistical analysis, and a  value below 0.05 was considered significant. Compared to the healthy ankles, the synovial fluid in ankles with acute intra-articular fracture had elevated levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and proteases (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, TNF, IFN, MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13). The levels of cartilage degradation products (ACG, CTX-2) and metabolic mediators (TGF-1 and TGF-2) were also significantly higher. Synovial concentrations of ACG, IL-12-p70, IFN, IL-4, and bFGF correlated with serum levels. While most of the examined synovial cytokines were unchanged after implant removal, IL-4 and IL-6 levels were upregulated. We show that an acute ankle fracture is followed by an inflammatory reaction and cartilage degeneration. These data contribute to the current understanding of the protein regulation behind the development of PTOA and is a further step towards supplementing the current surgical treatment.

       "  'abstract': 'Regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) is limited by the presence of a glial scar and inhibitory cell signaling pathways that favor scar formation over regrowth of endogenous neurons. Tissue engineering techniques, including the use of allografted neural networks, have shown promise for nervous system repair in prior studies. Through the use of a minimally invasive injury model in rats, we describe the implantation of micro-tissue engineered neural networks (micro-TENNs) across a region of SCI, spanning the glial scar to promote axonal regeneration. Forty-three female Sprague-Dawley rats were included in this study. Micro-TENNs were preformed  before implant, and comprised rat sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons projecting long bundled axonal tracts within the lumen of a biocompatible hydrogel columnar encasement (1.2\\u2009cm long; 701\\u2009μm outer diameter\\u2009×\\u2009300\\u2009μm inner diameter). Animals were injured using a 2F embolectomy catheter inflated within the epidural space. After a 2-week recovery period, micro-TENNs were stereotactically implanted across the injury. Animals were euthanized at 1 week and 1 month after implantation, and the tissue was interrogated for the survival of graft DRG neurons and outgrowth of axons. No intraoperative deaths were noted with implantation of the micro-TENNs to span the injury cavity. Graft DRG axons were found to survive at 1 week postimplant within the hydrogel encasement. Graft-derived axonal outgrowth was observed within the spinal cord up to 4.5\\u2009mm from the implant site at 1 month postinjury. Limited astroglial response was noted within the host, suggesting minimal trauma and scar formation in response to the graft. Micro-TENN sensory neurons survive and extend axons into the host spinal cord following a minimally invasive SCI in rats. This work serves as the foundation for future studies investigating the use of micro-TENNs as a living bridge to promote recovery following SCI. Impact statement As spinal cord injury pathology develops, the establishment of a glial scar puts an end to the hope of regeneration and recovery from the consequent neurological deficits. Therefore, growing attention is given to bioengineered scaffolds that can bridge the lesions bordered by this scar tissue. The utilization of longitudinally aligned preformed neural networks-referred to as micro-tissue engineered neural networks (TENNs)-presents a promising opportunity to provide a multipurpose bridging strategy that may take advantage of several potential mechanisms of host regeneration. In addition to providing physical support for regenerating spinal cord axons, micro-TENNs may serve as a functional \"cable\" that restores lost connections within the spinal cord.',\n",

We report on 16 consecutive patients who have undergone cranioplasty surgery for an extensive skull defect after decompressive surgery and in which the bone flap was not available. We present the workflow for the implant production using a 3D-printer-assisted molding technique. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were analyzed/evaluated. Eleven out of our 16 patients (68.7%) presented with extensive hemispheric bone defects. Indication for initial craniotomy were traumatic brain injury (4; 25%), acute subdural hematoma (4; 25%), ischemic stroke (3; 18.8%), tumor (3; 18.8%), and ruptured aneurysm (2; 12.5%). Median (range) operation time was 121 (89-206) minutes.\\xa0Median (range) intraoperative blood loss was 300\\xa0(100-3300) mL. The mean (range) follow-up period is 6 (0-21) months. Complications occurred in 7 out of our 16 patients (43.8%), in 6 (37.5%) of which a reoperation was required to evacuate an extra-axial hematoma (3; 50%), for shunting of an epidural fluid collection (1; 16.7%), or for skin flap necrosis (1; 16.7%). One patient (16.7%) developed a chronic asymptomatic subdural fluid collection that was stable over the follow-up period. Our workflow to intraoperatively produce patient-specific implants in a timely manner to cover cranial defects proved to be feasible. The results are cosmetically appealing, and postoperative CT scans show well-fitting implants. As implantable printable substrates are already available, we aim to advance and certify 3D-printed patient-specific implants in the near future. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system (CNS) and serves to connect the brain to the peripheral nervous system and peripheral tissues. The cell types that primarily comprise the spinal cord are neurons and several categories of glia, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Ependymal cells and small populations of endogenous stem cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, also reside in the spinal cord. Neurons are interconnected in circuits; those that process cutaneous sensory input are mainly located in the dorsal spinal cord, while those involved in proprioception and motor control are predominately located in the ventral spinal cord. Due to the importance of the spinal cord, neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries affecting the spinal cord will lead to motor deficits and loss of sensory inputs.Spinal cord injury (SCI), resulting in paraplegia and tetraplegia as a result of deleterious interconnected mechanisms encompassed by the primary and secondary injury, represents a heterogeneously behavioral and cognitive deficit that remains incurable. Following SCI, various barriers containing the neuroinflammation, neural tissue defect (neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), cavity formation, loss of neuronal circuitry, and function must be overcame. Notably, the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of cell-cell communication networks play critical roles in homeostatic, driving the pathophysiologic and consequent cognitive outcomes. In the spinal cord, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia are involved in not only development but also pathology. Glial cells play dual roles (negative vs. positive effects) in these processes. After SCI, detrimental effects usually dominate and significantly retard functional recovery, and curbing these effects is critical for promoting neurological improvement. Indeed, residential innate immune cells (microglia and astrocytes) and infiltrating leukocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), activated by SCI, give rise to full-blown inflammatory cascades. These inflammatory cells release neurotoxins (proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, free radicals, excitotoxic amino acids, nitric oxide (NO)), all of which partake in axonal and neuronal deficit.Given the various multifaceted obstacles in SCI treatment, a combinatorial therapy of cell transplantation and biomaterial implantation may be addressed in detail here. For the sake of preserving damaged tissue integrity and providing physical support and trophic supply for axon regeneration, MSC transplantation has come to the front stage in therapy for SCI with the constant progress of stem cell engineering. MSC transplantation promotes scaffold integration and regenerative growth potential. Integrating into the implanted scaffold, MSCs influence implant integration by improving the healing process. Conversely, biomaterial scaffolds offer MSCs with a sheltered microenvironment from the surrounding pathological changes, in addition to bridging connection spinal cord stump and offering physical and directional support for axonal regeneration. Besides, Biomaterial scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix to suppress immune responses.Here, we review the advances in combinatorial biomaterial scaffolds and MSC transplantation approach that targets certain aspects of various intercellular communications in the pathologic process following SCI. Finally, the challenges of biomaterial-supported MSC transplantation and its future direction for neuronal regeneration will be presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) has enabled volitional lower extremity movements in individuals with chronic and clinically motor complete spinal cord injury and no clinically detectable brain influence. The aim of this study was to understand whether the individuals' neuroanatomical characteristics or positioning of the scES electrode were important factors influencing the extent of initial recovery of lower limb voluntary movements in those with clinically motor complete paralysis. We hypothesized that there would be significant correlations between the number of joints moved during attempts with scES prior to any training interventions and the amount of cervical cord atrophy above the injury, length of post-traumatic myelomalacia and the amount of volume coverage of lumbosacral enlargement by the stimulation electrode array. The clinical and imaging records of 20 individuals with chronic and clinically motor complete spinal cord injury who underwent scES implantation were reviewed and analysed using MRI and X-ray integration, image segmentation and spinal cord volumetric reconstruction techniques. All individuals that participated in the scES study (n\\u2009=\\u200920) achieved, to some extent, lower extremity voluntary movements post scES implant and prior to any locomotor, voluntary movement or cardiovascular training. The correlation results showed that neither the cross-section area of spinal cord at C3 (n\\u2009=\\u200919, r\\u2009=\\u20090.33, P\\u2009=\\u20090.16) nor the length of severe myelomalacia (n\\u2009=\\u200918, r = -0.02, P\\u2009=\\u20090.93) correlated significantly with volitional lower limb movement ability. However, there was a significant, moderate correlation (n\\u2009=\\u200920, r\\u2009=\\u20090.59, P\\u2009=\\u20090.006) between the estimated percentage of the lumbosacral enlargement coverage by the paddle electrode as well as the position of the paddle relative to the maximal lumbosacral enlargement and the conus tip (n\\u2009=\\u200920, r\\u2009=\\u20090.50, P\\u2009=\\u20090.026) with the number of joints moved volitionally. These results suggest that greater coverage of the lumbosacral enlargement by scES may improve motor recovery prior to any training, possibly because of direct modulatory effects on the spinal networks that control lower extremity movements indicating the significant role of motor control at the level of the spinal cord.\",\n",

Interest in models of mild and repeat mild TBI has grown due to reports of lasting morbidity following sports- or combat-related injury.

It is critical, therefore, to develop flexible models to evaluate which parameters of injury are associated with brain vulnerability or poor chronic outcome compared to normal recovery.

       "  'abstract': 'Syndrome of the trephined (ST) refers to the rare, reversible event of neurological deterioration following craniectomy. ST is also known as \"sinking skin flap syndrome\" and typically occurs in the weeks to months following operation. The mechanism underlying syndromic onset is poorly understood. Changes to cerebrospinal fluid flow, alteration of temperature-related perfusion, and scarring at the intracranial surgical site have all been proposed. Patients present with a variety of symptoms related to paradoxical increased intracranial pressure. Sometimes falsely attributed as a consequence of the initial cranial insult, ST is more specifically a symptomatic process resulting as direct consequence of the craniectomy procedure. With timely identification and subsequent cranioplasty, the associated neurological dysfunction can be corrected - this rectification being the primary confirmatory feature of the syndrome. A 59-year-old female was seen with regards to a wound of the temporoparietal scalp, with exposed cranial implant. She had suffered a traumatic brain injury and underwent craniectomy after a motor vehicle accident 10\\xa0years prior. Her injury was complicated by necrosis of her cranial bone flap after reimplantation and at least 10 subsequent attempts to reconstruct her wound. When delayed cranial reconstruction was attempted on two separate occasions, the patient suffered severe syndrome of the trephined and required hospitalization for symptoms of impending herniation. Ultimately, she required revision and replacement of titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi free flap for soft tissue coverage of the titanium mesh. This case presents a unique surgical challenge in that chronic infection was perpetuated by the replacement of implant material in the wound. Soft tissue reconstruction alone was not possible given the patient\\'s severe ST. Free tissue transfer was required in order to bring vascularized myofascial tissue to prevent recolonization of the newly implanted mesh and allow the cranial wound to heal. ',\n",

In this study, we assessed its utility in adult Fischer 344 (F344) rats as a stabilizing scaffold and vehicle for grafted cells after mild thoracic (thoracic level 10 [T10]) contusion spinal cord injury (SCI). Treatments were as follows: Fmoc-DIKVAV alone, Fmoc-DIKVAV containing viable or nonviable rat mesenchymal precursor cells (rMPCs), and rMPCs alone. The majority of post-SCI treatments were administered at 11-15 days (mean 13.5 days) and the results then compared to SCI-only control (no treatment) rats. Postinjury behavior was quantified using open field locomotion (BBB) and LadderWalk analysis. After perfusion at 8 weeks, longitudinal spinal cord sections were immunostained with a panel of antibodies. Qualitatively, in the SAP-only treatment group, implanted gels contained regenerate axons as well as astrocytic, immune cell, and extracellular matrix (ECM) component profiles. Grafts of Fmoc-DIKVAV plus viable or nonviable rMPCs also contained numerous macrophages/microglia and ECM components, but astrocytes were generally confined to implant margins, and axons were rare. Quantitative analysis showed that, while average cyst size was reduced in all experimental groups, the decrease compared to SCI-only controls was only significant in the SAP and rMPC treatment groups. There was gradual improvement in functionality after SCI, but a consistent trend was only seen between the rMPC treatment group and SCI-only controls. In summary, after contusion SCI, implantation of Fmoc-DIKVAV hydrogel provided a favorable microenvironment for cellular infiltration and axonal regrowth, a supportive role that unexpectedly appeared to be compromised by prior inclusion of rMPCs into the gel matrix. Impact statement The self-assembling peptide hydrogel, Fmoc-DIKVAV, is a biomimetic scaffold that is an effective cell and drug delivery system in the injured brain. We examined whether this hydrogel, alone or combined with mesenchymal precursor cells, was also able to stabilise spinal cord tissue after thoracic contusion injury and improve morphological and behavioral outcomes. While improved functionality was not consistently seen, there was reduced cyst size and increased tissue sparing in some groups. There was regenerative axonal growth into hydrogels, but only in initially cell-free implants. This type of polymer is a suitable candidate for further testing in spinal cord injury models.',\n",

As hydrogels are more similar to nerve tissue, functional hydrogels have become a promising candidate for bioelectronics. Meanwhile, interfacing functional hydrogels and living tissues is at the forefront of bioelectronics. The peripheral nerve injury often leads to paralysis, chronic pain, neurologic disorders, and even disability, because it has affected the bioelectrical signal transmission between the brain and the rest of body. Here, a kind of light-stimuli-responsive and stretchable conducting polymer hydrogel (CPH) is developed to explore artificial nerve. The conductivity of CPH can be enhanced when illuminated by near-infrared light, which can promote the conduction of the bioelectrical signal. When CPH is mechanically elongated, it still has high durability of conductivity and, thus, can accommodate unexpected strain of nerve tissues in motion. Thereby, CPH can better serve as an implant of the serious peripheral nerve injury , especially in the case that the length of the missing nerve exceeds 10 mm.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical for targeted therapy of the central nerve system (CNS). Six peptide vectors were covalently attached to a 50 kDa poly(β-l-malic acid)-trileucine polymer forming P/LLL(40%)/vector conjugates. The vectors were Angiopep-2 (AP2), B6, Miniap-4 (M4), and d-configurated peptides D1, D3, and ACI-89, with specificity for transcytosis receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), transferrin receptor (TfR), bee venom-derived ion channel, and Aβ/LRP-1 related transcytosis complex, respectively. The BBB-permeation efficacies were substantially increased (\"boosted\") in vector conjugates of P/LLL(40%). We have found that the copolymer group binds at the endothelial membrane and, by an allosterically membrane rearrangement, exposes the sites for vector-receptor complex formation. The specificity of vectors is indicated by competition experiments with nonconjugated vectors. P/LLL(40%) does not function as an inhibitor, suggesting that the copolymer binding site is eliminated after binding of the vector-nanoconjugate. The two-step mechanism, binding to endothelial membrane and allosteric exposure of transcytosis receptors, is supposed to be an integral feature of nanoconjugate-transcytosis pathways.  brain delivery signatures of the nanoconjugates were recapitulated in mouse brains of normal, tumor (glioblastoma), and Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) models. BBB permeation of the tumor was most efficient, followed by normal and then AD-like brain. In tumor-bearing and normal brains, AP2 was the top performing vector; however, in AD models, D3 and D1 peptides were superior ones. The TfR vector B6 was equally efficient in normal and AD-model brains. Cross-permeation efficacies are manifested through modulated vector coligation and dosage escalation such as supra-linear dose dependence and crossover transcytosis activities.',\n",

For example, microbiota-derived Indoles via tryptophan metabolism prevented Aβ accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation, restored synaptic plasticity, and then promoted the cognitive and behavioral ability of APP/PS1 mice. The imbalanced compositions of Indoles-producing bacteria with tryptophan deficiency were found in male APP/PS1 mice, but the molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Our current study revealed that Indoles (including indole, indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-propionic acid) upregulated the production of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), inhibited the activation of the NF-κB signal pathway as well as the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-18, alleviating the inflammatory response of APP/PS1 mice.

Accumulation of ROS can lead to cell death, neurodegeneration, and neurological deficit. Therefore, the design and application of functional materials with ROS scavenging ability is of great significance for neural repair. Herein, an injectable and antioxidant hydrogel was developed for TBI treatment based on the Schiff base reaction of gallic acid-conjugated gelatin (GGA) and oxidized dextran (Odex). The resulting GGA/Odex hydrogel could effectively scavenge DPPH and ABTS radicals, as well as protect cells from the oxidative damage in vitro. Moreover, GGA/Odex hydrogel possessed well biocompatible features. In a moderate TBI mouse model, in situ implantation of GGAOdex hydrogel efficiently facilitated neurogenesis and promoted the motor, learning and memory abilities. Also, this composite hydrogel suppressed oxidative stress and inflammation via the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the regulating of inflammatory factors secretion and macrophage/microglia polarization. Therefore, this injectable and ROS-scavenging GGAOdex hydrogel is a promising biomaterial for tissue regenerative medicine, including TBI and other tissue repair relevant to raised ROS circumstance.',\n",

Clasping was increased independently of age, and its severity worsened with repeated testing. In contrast, the impairment of coordination worsened with the progress of the disease. The gait score was sensitive to genotype since early stages, and the worse ledge score was evident at 16 months. Kyphosis and ledge scores were sensitive to age.

       "  'abstract': 'Expression of selenoproteins is widespread in neurons of the central nervous system. There is continuous evidence presented over decades that low levels of selenium or selenoproteins are linked to seizures and epilepsy indicating a failure of the inhibitory system. Many developmental processes in the brain depend on the thyroid hormone T3. T3 levels can be locally increased by the action of iodothyronine deiodinases on the prohormone T4. Since deiodinases are selenoproteins, it is expected that selenoprotein deficiency may affect development of the central nervous system. Studies in genetically modified mice or clinical observations of patients with rare diseases point to a role of selenoproteins in brain development and degeneration. In particular selenoprotein P is central to brain function by virtue of its selenium transport function into and within the brain. We summarize which selenoproteins are essential for the brain, which processes depend on selenoproteins, and what is known about genetic deficiencies of selenoproteins in humans.

       "  'abstract': 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with both immune and neurodegenerative components as the underlying causes. Cytokines are key components of the inflammatory processes and their crucial roles in the inflammatory aspect of MS are undeniable. Several studies have pointed to the apparent change in Cytokines in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IM253 treatment on inflammation and antioxidant defense in the cerebral corpus callosum of the C57BL/6 mouse, an Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and as a most commonly used experimental model of MS. During the course of study, clinical evaluation was performed and eventually histological and molecular analysis on brain samples was carried out. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that treatment with IM253 causes a significant reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine coding genes including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17 as well as a significant increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant enzyme coding genes including TGF-β, GPX-1, and Cat. Histological studies also show that treatment with IM253 can reduce demyelination and inflammation (p<0.001). In addition, the GPX-1 enzyme activity evaluation also demonstrated that total antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in IM253 treated mice (p<0.001). Overall, our results suggest that IM253 could ameliorate the severity of EAE, probably because of its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and support the preclinical effects of IM253 as a potential therapeutic intervention.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"ConspectusScientific excursions into the unknown are often characterized by unanticipated twists and turns that may lead in directions that never could have been predicted. Decisions made during the course of these explorations determine what we discover. This Account chronicles one such journey that began with a challenge encountered during the synthesis of a natural product and then unfolded over more than 30 years to focus on unmet needs in neuroscience. Specifically, while developing a concise approach to tetrahydroalstonine, a heteroyohimboid alkaloid having α-adrenergic activity, we faced the predicament of assembling a key intermediate. Solving this problem resulted in the serendipitous discovery of the vinylogous Mannich reaction and a productive program wherein we used this powerful construction as a key step in the syntheses of numerous alkaloids. However, we also realized that lessons learned from the synthesis of tetrahydroalstonine could be generalized to invent a new strategy for preparing diverse collections of substituted nitrogen heterocycles that could be screened against biological targets. The approach featured the combination of several reactants in a multicomponent assembly process to give a functionalized intermediate that could be elaborated by various ring-forming reactions to give heterocyclic scaffolds that could be further diversified. Screening these compound sets against a broad range of biological targets revealed some intriguing hits, but none of them led to a productive collaboration in translational research. Notwithstanding this setback, we screened curated members of our collections against proteins in the central nervous system and discovered some substituted B-norbenzomorphans that were selective for the enigmatic sigma-2 receptor (σR), an understudied protein that had been primarily associated with cancer. With scant knowledge of its role in neuroscience, we posited that small molecules that bind to σR might be neuroprotective, thus launching a new venture. In parallel investigations we prepared analogues of the initial hits, explored their effects in animal models of neurodegenerative and neurological conditions, and identified σR as transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97). After first establishing the neuroprotective effects of several σR/TMEM97 ligands in a transgenic  model of neurodegeneration, we showed that one of these has procognitive effects and reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We then identified a closely related σR/TMEM97 ligand that mitigates hippocampal-dependent memory deficits, prevents axon degeneration, and protects neurons and oligodendrocytes after traumatic brain injury. In a recent study, this compound was shown to protect retinal ganglion cells from retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury. In other collaborative investigations, we have shown that related, but structurally distinct, σR/TMEM97 ligands alleviate neuropathic pain, while a σR/TMEM97 ligand representing yet another chemotype reduces impairments associated with alcohol withdrawal. More recently, we have shown that σR/TMEM97 ligands enhance survival of cortical neurons in a neuronal model of Huntington's disease. Translational and mechanistic studies in these and other areas are in progress. Solving a problem we faced in natural product synthesis thus served as an unexpected gateway to discoveries that could lead to entirely new approaches to treat neurodegenerative and neurological conditions by targeting σR/TMEM97, a protein that has never been associated with these afflictions.\",\n",

Using the RiboTag method in mice, translational responses of five neural subtypes to acquired prion disease (PrD) were measured. Pre-onset and disease onset timepoints were chosen based on longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed a gradual increase in theta power between 10- and 18-weeks after prion injection, resembling a clinical feature of human PrD. At disease onset, marked by significantly increased theta power and histopathological lesions, mice had pronounced translatome changes in all five cell types despite appearing normal. Remarkably, at a pre-onset stage, prior to EEG and neuropathological changes, we found that 1) translatomes of astrocytes indicated reduced synthesis of ribosomal and mitochondrial components, 2) glutamatergic neurons showed increased expression of cytoskeletal genes, and 3) GABAergic neurons revealed reduced expression of circadian rhythm genes. These data demonstrate that early translatome responses to neurodegeneration emerge prior to conventional markers of disease and are cell type-specific. Therapeutic strategies may need to target multiple pathways in specific populations of cells, early in disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate (MTX), raltitrexed (RTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), hydroxyurea (HU), and retinoic acid (RA), and valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic drug, all can cause malformations in the developing central nervous system (CNS), such as neural tube defects (NTDs). However, the common pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of NTDs caused by MTX, RTX, 5-FU, HU, RA, and VPA (MRFHRV), based on network pharmacology and molecular biology experiments. The MRFHRV targets were integrated with disease targets, to find the potential molecules related to MRFHRV-induced NTDs. Protein-protein interaction analysis and molecular docking were performed to analyze these common targets. Utilizing the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways, we analyzed and searched the possible causative pathogenic mechanisms by crucial targets and the signaling pathway. Results showed that MRFHRV induced NTDs through several key targets (including TP53, MAPK1, HSP90AA1, ESR1, GRB2, HDAC1, EGFR, PIK3CA, RXRA, and FYN) and multiple signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting that abnormal proliferation and differentiation could be critical pathogenic contributors in NTDs induced by MRFHRV. These results were further validated by CCK8 assay in mouse embryonic stem cells and GFAP staining in embryonic brain tissue. This study indicated that chemotherapeutic and antiepileptic agents induced NTDs might through predicted targets TP53, MAPK1, GRB2, HDAC1, EGFR, PIK3CA, RXRA, and FYN and multiple signaling pathways. More caution was required for the clinical administration for women with childbearing potential and pregnant.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are aggressive, and they develop metastasis at earlier stages, relapse more frequently, and exhibits poorer prognosis than other subtypes of breast cancer. Due to the lack of estrogen receptor for endocrine therapy and HER2 for targeted therapy, new targeted therapies for TNBCs are urgently needed. Enzalutamide is a second-generation androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor, and HC-1119 is a new synthetic deuterated enzalutamide. Owing to the isotope effect, HC-1119 has many advantages over enzalutamide, including slow metabolism, high plasma concentration and low brain exposure. However, the efficacy of HC-1119 in inhibition of AR function in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been studied. In this study, we found high-level AR expression in both Hs578T and SUM159PT TNBC cell lines. Activation of AR by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in both cell lines increased AR protein, induced AR-nuclear localization, enhanced cell migration and invasion in culture, and promoted liver metastasis in mice. Importantly, cotreatment with HC-1119 of these cells efficiently abolished all of these effects of DHT on both Hs578T and SUM159PT cells. These results indicate that HC-1119 is a very effective new second-generation AR antagonist that can inhibit the migration, invasion and metastasis of the AR-positive TNBC cells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'cerebral malaria (CM) is an important complication of malaria with a high mortality rate. Artesunate is recommended as the first-line artemisinin compound treatment for severe malaria. Due to the difficulty of obtaining brain tissue samples clinically, the use of animals to research host responses to CM parasite infections is necessary. Rodent malaria models allow for detailed time series studies of host responses in multiple organs. To date, studies on the transcriptome of severe malaria are only limited to the parasites in the peripheral blood of patients, and there is little data on the transcriptional changes in brain tissue in mice with CM treated with artesunate. in this study, fresh tissue samples (three biological replicates per mouse) from the same area of the brain in each animal were collected from the uninfected, -infected and artesunate-treated  mice, and then transcriptome research was performed by the RNA-seq technique. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) included , , , , , , and . Among which, , ,  and  were further verified and validated  qRT-PCR and ELISA. This revealed that  ( < 0.0001),  ( < 0.05) and  ( < 0.05) were significantly up-regulated in the -infected  uninfected group, while  ( < 0.0001) and  ( < 0.05) were significantly down-regulated after artesunate treatment. All DEGs were closely related to the top 3 artesunate treatment pathways, including the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, apoptosis, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. the mechanism of improving the prognosis of cerebral malaria by artesunate may not only involve the killing of plasmodium but also the inhibition of a cytokine storm in the host. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism by which artesunate improves the prognosis of cerebral malaria. ',\n",

Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is an essential inflammasome protein known to contribute to the development of several neurological diseases. However, a specific role for AIM2 in PD has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the effect of AIM2 in the N-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model by use of various knockout and bone marrow chimeric mice. The mechanism of action for AIM2 in PD was assessed by RNA-sequencing and in vitro primary microglial transfection. Results were validated in the A30P transgenic mouse model of PD. In the MPTP mouse model, AIM2 activation was found to negatively regulate neuro-inflammation independent of the inflammasome. Microglial AIM2 deficiency exacerbated behavioral and pathological features of both MPTP-induced and transgenic PD mouse models. Mechanistically, AIM2 reduced cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-mediated antiviral-related inflammation by inhibition of AKT-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation. These results demonstrate microglial AIM2 to inhibit the antiviral-related neuro-inflammation associated with PD and provide for a foundation upon which to identify new therapeutic targets for treatment of the disease.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) is encoded by gene ADGRG1 from chromosome 16q21 and is homologously encoded in mice, at chromosome 8. Both 687 and 693 splice forms are present in humans and mice. GPR56 has a 381 amino acid-long N-terminal extracellular segment and a GPCR proteolysis site upstream from the first transmembrane domain. GPR56 is mainly expressed in heart, brain, thyroid, platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that GPR56 promotes the formation of myelin sheaths and the development of oligodendrocytes in the cerebral cortex of the central nervous system. Moreover, GPR56 contributes to the development and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, induces adipogenesis and regulates the function of immune cells. The lack of GPR56 leads to nervous system dysfunction, platelet disorders, and infertility. Abnormal expression of GPR56 is related to the malignant transformation and tumour metastasis of several cancers including melanoma, neuroglioma, and gastrointestinal cancer. Metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases are also associated with dysregulation of GPR56 expression, and GPR56 is involved in the pharmacological resistance to some antidepressant and cancer drug treatments. In this review, the molecular structure, expression profile, and signal transduction of GPR56 is introduced, and physiological and pathological functions of GRP56 are comprehensively summarized. Attributing to its significant biological functions and its long N-terminal extracellular region that interacts with multiple ligands, GPR56 is becoming an attractive therapeutic target in treating neurological and hematopoietic diseases.',\n",

However, those monoamine-based antidepressants used in clinical practice have been found to have various limitations. Therefore, currently it is very necessary to explore novel antidepressant targets and medications. As a main active component extracted from , oroxylin A possesses many pharmacological functions such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammation and neuroprotection. Here, the present study aims to investigate whether oroxylin A possess antidepressant-like actions using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and chronic restraint stress (CRS) models of depression, forced swim test, tail suspension test, open field test, sucrose preference test, western blotting, immunofluorescence and viral-mediated gene interference. Our results revealed that treatment of oroxylin A fully prevented both the CUMS-induced and CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice. Moreover, the protecting effects of oroxylin A against CUMS and CRS on mice behaviors were accompanied with a significant enhancement on the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated tyrosine kinase B (pTrkB), phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus remarkably abolished the antidepressant-like efficacy of oroxylin A in both the CUMS and CRS models of depression, proving that the hippocampal BDNF-TrkB system participates in the antidepressant mechanism of oroxylin A. In summary, our findings are the first evidence showing that oroxylin A possesses potential of being an antidepressant candidate.',\n",

In this study, a severe TBI mouse model was created using controlled cortical impact (CCI), and a surgical model of DC was established. Furthermore, a series of neurological function assessments were performed to better understand the pathophysiological changes after DC. In this study, mice were randomly allocated into three groups, namely, CCI group, CCI+DC group, and Sham group. The mice in the CCI and CCI+DC groups received CCI after opening a bone window, and after brain injury, immediately returned the bone window to simulate skull condition after a TBI. The CCI+DC group underwent DC and contused tissue removal 6 h after CCI. The mice in the CCI group underwent the same anesthesia process; however, no further treatment of the bone window and trauma was performed. The mice in the Sham group underwent anesthesia and the process of opening the skin and bone window, but not in the CCI group. Changes in Modified Neurological Severity Score, rotarod performance, Morris water maze, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB), inflammatory factors, neuronal apoptosis, and glial cell expression were evaluated. Compared with the CCI group, the CCI+DC group had significantly lower ICP, superior neurological and motor function at 24 h after injury, and less severe BBB damage after injury. Most inflammatory cytokine expressions and the number of apoptotic cells in the brain tissue of mice in the CCI+DC group were lower than in the CCI group at 3 days after injury, with markedly reduced astrocyte and microglia expression. However, the degree of brain edema in the CCI+DC group was greater than in the CCI group, and neurological and motor functions, as well as spatial cognitive and learning ability, were significantly poorer at 14 days after injury.',\n",

In the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, EUF was observed to ameliorate DNA damage in mouse cerebellum and cerebral cortex caused by acute ethanol administration, which was further confirmed by the morphological observation. The protective effects of EUF were associated with increasing total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities, and a decrease in nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) levels. Molecular docking results demonstrated that compounds , , , and  from EUF have a strong affinity to the Keap1 Kelch domain to hinder the interaction of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) with Keap1. These findings suggest that EUF is a potent inhibitor of ethanol-induced brain injury possibly via the inhibition of oxidative stress.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Excitotoxicity is thought to be an important factor in the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Evidence from human and animal studies also indicates that early signs of ALS include degeneration of motor nerve terminals at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), before degeneration of motor neuron cell bodies. Here we used a model of excitotoxicity at NMJs in isolated mouse muscle, utilizing the organophosphorus (OP) compound omethoate, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity. Acute exposure to omethoate (100 μM) induced prolonged motor endplate contractures in response to brief tetanic nerve stimulation at 20-50 Hz. In some muscle fibers, Fluo-4 fluorescence showed association of these contractures with explosive increases in Ca (\"calcium bombs\") localized to motor endplates. Calcium bombs were strongly and selectively mitigated by increasing Mg concentration in the bathing medium from 1 to 5 mM. Overnight culture of nerve-muscle preparations from  mice in omethoate or other OP insecticide components and their metabolites (dimethoate, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexanol) induced degeneration of NMJs. This degeneration was also strongly mitigated by increasing [Mg] from 1 to 5 mM. Thus, equivalent increases in extracellular [Mg] mitigated both post-synaptic calcium bombs and degeneration of NMJs. The data support a link between Ca and excitotoxicity at NMJs and suggest that elevating extracellular [Mg] could be an effective intervention in treatment of synaptic pathology induced by excitotoxic triggers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Remembering the location of food is essential for survival. Rodents and humans employ mainly hippocampus-dependent spatial strategies, but when being stressed they shift to striatum-mediated stimulus-based strategies. To investigate underlying brain circuits, we tested mice with a heightened stress susceptibility due to a lack of the GABA-synthetizing enzyme GAD65 (GAD65-/- mice) in a dual solution task. Here, GAD65-/- mice preferred to locate a food reward in an open field via a proximal cue, while their wildtype littermates preferred a spatial strategy. The analysis of cFos co-activation across brain regions and of stress-induced mRNA expression changes of GAD65 pointed towards the hippocampal dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) as a central structure for mediating stress effects on strategy choices via GAD65. Reducing the GAD65 expression locally in the dDG by a shRNA mediated knock down was sufficient to replicate the phenotype of the global GAD65 knock out and to increase dDG excitability. Using DREADD vectors to specifically interfere with dDG circuit activity during dual solution retrieval but not learning confirmed that the dDG modulates strategy choices and that a balanced excitability of this structure is necessary to establish spatial strategy preference. These data highlight the dDG as a critical hub for choosing between spatial and non-spatial foraging strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The increasing incidence of preterm birth has led to a global problem of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm neonates as a result of brain injury. There is still a lack of models mimicking diffuse white matter injury (WMI) in preterm neonates that can be applied to transgenic mice. The right common carotid artery of the neonatal mouse was ligated on postnatal day 3 (P3) C57BL/6 mice and followed by 80, 90, or 100 min of hypoxia using a mixture of 10%±0.2% oxygen-nitrogen. The most suitable model was chosen by characterizing the effects of this hypoxic-ischemic insult on development of myelin, glial cell conditions, and neurological outcomes by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining performed at postnatal day 17 (P17), western blot measuring myelin basic protein (MBP) at postnatal day 10 (P10) and P17, immunofluorescence staining of MBP-neurofilament protein heavy chain (NFH), oligodendrocyte transcription factor-2 (Olig2)-adenomatous polyposis coli clone (CC1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionic calcium linker protein (Iba-1) at P17, electron microscopy observing myelin microstructure at postnatal day 52 (P52) and behavioral testing at postnatal day 45-50 (P45-P50). The 90-min group showed neuroanatomical changes in the ipsilateral side of the brain, the 80-min group showed minor changes, and the 100-min group showed severe injury. Mice in the 90-min group subsequently showed marked activation of astrocytes, augmentation of microglia, a notable decrease in expression of MBP with a normal level of NFH, long-term cognitive dysfunction, and impairment of the myelin ultrastructure in adulthood. In conclusion, a mouse model of preterm diffuse WMI rather than cystic periventricular leukomalacia was successfully achieved by ligating one of the common carotid arteries on P3 followed by 90 min of hypoxia in a mixture of 10%±0.2% oxygen-nitrogen. The attempt provides an adequate translational animal model for elucidating the underlying mechanism. ',\n",

Paeoniflorin has been widely studied in experimental models and clinical trials for cancer treatment because of its anti-cancer property. However, the underlying mechanisms of paeoniflorin in EMT and angiogenesis in glioblastoma was not fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate whether paeoniflorin inhibits EMT and angiogenesis, which involving c-Met suppression, while exploring the potential ways of c-Met degradation. In our study, we found that paeoniflorin inhibited EMT  downregulating c-Met signaling in glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, overexpressing c-Met in glioblastoma cells abolished the effects of paeoniflorin on EMT. Moreover, paeoniflorin showed anti-angiogenic effects by suppressing cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation through downregulating c-Met in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). And c-Met overexpression in HUVECs offset the effects of paeoniflorin on angiogenesis. Additionally, paeoniflorin induced autophagy activation involving mTOR/P70S6K/S6 signaling and promoted c-Met autophagic degradation, a process dependent on K63-linked c-Met polyubiquitination. Finally, paeoniflorin suppressed mesenchymal makers (snail, vimentin, N-cadherin) and inhibited angiogenesis  the identical mechanism in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. The  and  experiments showed that paeoniflorin treatment inhibited EMT, angiogenesis and activated autophagy. What's more, for the first time, we identified c-Met may be a potential target of paeoniflorin and demonstrated paeoniflorin downregulated c-Met  K63-linked c-Met polyubiquitination-dependent autophagic degradation.

An experimental mouse model with SAH was established by the intravascular perforation, and the in vitro SAH model was constructed by exposing cocultured primary neurons and microglia to oxyhemoglobin. After overexpression of miR-340-5p in mice, the neurobehavioral disorders were evaluated by Garcia test; brain edema was evaluated by wet-dry method; blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage was detected with Evan's blue staining; levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After miR-340-5p was transfected in to microglia, Iba-1 expression was detected by Western blot, and neuronal apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry. The targeting relationship between miR-340-5p and STING was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. MiR-340-5p was significantly inhibited in the brain tissues of mice with SAH and microglia of SAH model, and neurological impairment, brain edema, BBB injury, and neuroinflammation were significantly alleviated in mice after overexpressing miR-340-5p.

       "  'abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory and cognitive impairments. Neurogenesis, which is related to memory and cognitive function, is reduced in the brains of patients with AD. Therefore, enhancing neurogenesis is a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Hesperidin (HSP), a bioflavonoid found primarily in citrus plants, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of HSP on neurogenesis in neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from the brain of mouse embryos and five familial AD (5xFAD) mice. In NSCs, HSP significantly increased the proliferation of NSCs by activating adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling, but did not affect NSC differentiation into neurons and astrocytes. HSP administration restored neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice via AMPK/brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B/CREB signaling, thereby decreasing amyloid-beta accumulation and ameliorating memory dysfunction. Collectively, these preclinical findings suggest that HSP is a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of AD.\",\n",

No global modification in the Pl amounts was observed when evaluated by gas chromatographic analysis of dimethyl acetals (DMAs). However, the analysis of individual molecular species of Pls by liquid chromatography revealed a reduced abundance of major species of ethanolamine Pls (PlsEtn)-PE(P-18:0/22:6) and PE(P-34:1)-in the cortex of mice fed a diet supplemented with inulin. DMA and expression levels of genes (, ,  and ) encoding key enzymes of Pl biosynthesis or degradation were not altered in the liver and in the cortex of mice exposed to inulin. In addition, the fatty acid profile and the amount of lyso forms derived from PlsEtn were not modified in the cortex by inulin consumption.

The molecular mechanisms maintaining GSCs need to be elucidated in more detail for the development of GSC-targeted therapy. In comparison with patient-derived GSCs and their differentiated counterparts, we herein demonstrated for the first time that phospholipase C (PLC)ε was highly expressed in GSCs, in contrast to other PLC isoforms. A broad-spectrum PLC inhibitor suppressed the viability of GSCs, but not their stemness. Nevertheless, the knockdown of PLCε suppressed the survival of GSCs and induced cell death. The stem cell capacity of residual viable cells was also suppressed. Moreover, the survival of mice that were transplanted with PLCε knockdown-GSCs was longer than the control group. PLCε maintained the stemness of GSCs via the activation of JNK. The present study demonstrated for the first time that PLCε plays a critical role in maintaining the survival, stemness, and tumor initiation capacity of GSCs.

Importantly, restoring glucose availability by pharmacological agents or genetic manipulation has been shown to protect against Aβ toxicity, ameliorate AD pathology, and increase lifespan. Lithium, a therapeutic agent widely used as a treatment for mood disorders, has been shown to attenuate AD pathology and promote glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. However, despite its widespread use in neuropsychiatric disorders, lithium's effects on the brain have been poorly characterized. Here we evaluated the effect of lithium on glucose metabolism in hippocampal neurons from wild-type (WT) and APPSwe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice. Our results showed that lithium significantly stimulates glucose uptake and replenishes ATP levels by preferential oxidation of glucose through glycolysis in neurons from WT mice. This increase was also accompanied by a strong increase in glucose transporter 3 (Glut3), the major carrier responsible for glucose uptake in neurons. Similarly, using hippocampal slices from APP-PS1 mice, we demonstrate that lithium increases glucose uptake, glycolytic rate, and the ATP:ADP ratio in a process that also involves the activation of AMPK. Together, our findings indicate that lithium stimulates glucose metabolism and can act as a potential therapeutic agent in AD.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) identifies a neurodevelopmental disease defined by social impairments and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. The etiology of ASD remains unclear; it primarily affects the brain, but a link between gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, inflammatory mucosal pathology and this disorder has been suggested. In particular, a central role seems to be played by an imbalance in pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a protein of innate immunity responsible for the regulation and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Through histochemical and immunohistochemical evaluations we analyzed the intestinal morphology and the immunopositivity of TLR4 and of other pro-inflammatory and apoptotic proteins in BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J mice. Morphological data showed that the mucosal tunica presented longer intestinal villi. The length of the villi and the epithelial surface determine the exchanges of the intestinal mucosa with luminal contents, modifying the microbiota composition. The biochemical and immunohistochemical results indicated a close relationship among the increase of TLR4 and the activation of NF-kB subunits (p65 and p50) and pro-inflammatory and apoptotic proteins, such as cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor nuclear factor-alpha, caspase-3, caspase-8. These preliminary results require more in-depth study but they suggest the TLR4 signaling pathway as a possible target for therapeutic approaches to reduce GI disorders in ASD.',\n",

Although pharmacotherapy has shown promise in the CDD mouse model, safe and effective clinical treatments are still far off. Recently, we found increased microglial activation in the brain of a mouse model of CDD, the 5 KO mouse, suggesting that a neuroinflammatory state, known to be involved in brain maturation and neuronal dysfunctions, may contribute to the pathophysiology of CDD. The present study aims to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of treatment with luteolin, a natural flavonoid known to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities, on brain development and behavior in a heterozygous  (+/-) female mouse, the mouse model of CDD that best resembles the genetic clinical condition. We found that inhibition of neuroinflammation by chronic luteolin treatment ameliorates motor stereotypies, hyperactive profile and memory ability in  +/- mice. Luteolin treatment also increases hippocampal neurogenesis and improves dendritic spine maturation and dendritic arborization of hippocampal and cortical neurons. These findings show that microglia overactivation exerts a harmful action in the  +/- brain, suggesting that treatments aimed at counteracting the neuroinflammatory process should be considered as a promising adjuvant therapy for CDD.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Experimental in vivo data have recently shown complementary neuroprotective actions of rhEPO and growth hormone (rhGH) in a neonatal murine model of hypoxic brain injury. Here, we hypothesized that rhGH and rhEPO mediate stabilization of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and regenerative vascular effects in hypoxic injury to the developing brain. Using an established model of neonatal hypoxia, neonatal mice (P7) were treated i.p. with rhGH (4000 µg/kg) or rhEPO (5000 IU/kg) 0/12/24 h after hypoxic exposure. After a regeneration period of 48 h or 7 d, cerebral mRNA expression of , its receptors and co-receptors, and selected tight junction proteins were determined using qRT-PCR and ELISA. Vessel structures were assessed by Pecam-1 and occludin (Ocln) IHC. While  expression increased significantly with rhGH treatment ( &lt; 0.01), expression of the  and TEK receptor tyrosine kinase () system remained unchanged. RhEPO increased  ( &lt; 0.05) and  ( &lt; 0.05) expression. While hypoxia reduced the mean vessel area in the parietal cortex compared to controls ( &lt; 0.05), rhGH and rhEPO prevented this reduction after 48 h of regeneration. Hypoxia significantly reduced the Ocln fraction of cortical vascular endothelial cells. Ocln signal intensity increased in the cortex in response to rhGH ( &lt; 0.05) and in the cortex and hippocampus in response to rhEPO ( &lt; 0.05). Our data indicate that rhGH and rhEPO have protective effects on hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and regenerative vascular effects during the post-hypoxic period in the developing brain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a combination of inflammatory and demyelination processes in the spinal cord and brain. Conventional drugs generally target the autoimmune response, without any curative effect. For that reason, there is a great interest in identifying novel agents with anti-inflammatory and myelinating effects, to counter the inflammation and cell death distinctive of the disease. An in vitro assay showed that curcumin (Cur) at 10 µM enhanced the proliferation of C8-D1A cells and modulated the production of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines in the cells stimulated by LPS. Furthermore, two in vivo pathophysiological experimental models were used to assess the effect of curcumin (100 mg/kg). The cuprizone model mimics the de/re-myelination aspect in MS, and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model (EAE) reflects immune-mediated events. We found that Cur alleviated the neurological symptomatology in EAE and modulated the expression of lymphocytes CD3 and CD4 in the spinal cord. Interestingly, Cur restored motor and behavioral deficiencies, as well as myelination, in demyelinated mice, as indicated by the higher index of luxol fast blue (LFB) and the myelin basic protein (MBP) intensity in the corpus callosum. Curcumin is a potential therapeutic agent that can diminish the MS neuroimmune imbalance and demyelination through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Classic Galactosemia (CG) is a devastating inborn error of the metabolism caused by mutations in the GALT gene encoding the enzyme galactose-1 phosphate uridylyltransferase in galactose metabolism. Severe complications of CG include neurological impairments, growth restriction, cognitive delays, and, for most females, primary ovarian insufficiency. The absence of the GALT enzyme leads to an accumulation of aberrant galactose metabolites, which are assumed to be responsible for the sequelae. There is no treatment besides the restriction of dietary galactose, which does not halt the development of the complications; thus, additional treatments are sorely needed. Supplements have been used in other inborn errors of metabolism but are not part of the therapeutic regimen for CG. The goal of this study was to test two generally recognized as safe supplements (purple sweet potato color (PSPC) and -inositol (MI)) that may impact cellular pathways contributing to the complications in CG. Our group uses a  gene-trapped mouse model to study the pathophysiology in CG, which phenocopy many of the complications. Here we report the ability of PSPC to ameliorate dysregulation in the ovary, brain, and liver of our mutant mice as well as positive results of MI supplementation in the ovary and brain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Pathological protein inclusion formation and propagation are the main causes of neuronal dysfunction in diverse neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, current disease-modifying therapeutic strategies have targeted this disease protein aggregation process. Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate α-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that -4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against β-sheet aggregate-mimic β23 cytotoxicities and potently prevented α-synucleinopathy in α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of α-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing α-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial α-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our translational study suggests that PCiv is advantageous as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, especially with its good synthetic yield, high brain distribution, and anti-aggregate activity. PCiv may be useful in the management of α-synuclein inclusion formation and propagation at different stages of PD.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'High-contrast visual stimulation promotes retinal regeneration and visual function, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we hypothesized that Müller cells (MCs), which express neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), could be key players in this retinal plasticity process. This hypothesis was tested by conducting in vivo and in vitro high-contrast stimulation of adult mice and MCs. Following stimulation, we examined the expression of BDNF and its inducible factor, VGF, in the retina and MCs. We also investigated the alterations in the expression of VGF, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and pro-inflammatory mediators in MCs, as well as their capacity to proliferate and develop a neurogenic or reactive gliosis phenotype after high-contrast stimulation and treatment with BDNF. Our results showed that high-contrast stimulation upregulated BDNF levels in MCs in vivo and in vitro. The additional BDNF treatment significantly augmented VGF production in MCs and their neuroprotective features, as evidenced by increased MC proliferation, neurodifferentiation, and decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory factors and the reactive gliosis marker GFAP. These results demonstrate that high-contrast stimulation activates the neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties of MCs, suggesting their possible direct involvement in retinal neuronal survival and improved functional outcomes in response to visual stimulation.',\n",

Recent studies have shown an age-dependent rise in the levels of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in AD. In addition, we discovered an aberrant interaction between VDAC1 and P-TAU in the brains of AD patients, which led to abnormalities in the structural and functional integrity of the mitochondria. The purpose of our study is to understand the protective effects of reduced VDAC1 against impaired mitochondrial dynamics and defective mitochondrial biogenesis in transgenic TAU mice. Recently, we crossed heterozygote VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1) mice with transgenic TAU mice to obtain double-mutant VDAC1/TAU mice. Our goal was to evaluate whether a partial decrease in VDAC1 lessens the amount of mitochondrial toxicity in transgenic Tau (P301L) mice. We found that mitochondrial fission proteins were significantly reduced, and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis proteins were increased in double-mutant mice compared to TAU mice. On the basis of these discoveries, the current work may have significance for the development of reduced-VDAC1-based treatments for individuals suffering from AD as well as other tauopathies.\",\n",

SFN and its precursor, glucoraphanin (sulforaphane glucosinolate, SGS), have been shown to ameliorate cognitive function in clinical trials and  studies. However, the effects of SGS on age-related cognitive decline in Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8) is unknown. In this study, we determined the preventive potential of SGS on age-related cognitive decline. One-month old SAMP8 mice or control SAM resistance 1 (SAMR1) mice were fed an ad libitum diet with or without SGS-containing broccoli sprout powder (0.3% / SGS in diet) until 13 months of age. SGS significantly improved long-term memory in SAMP8 at 12 months of age. Interestingly, SGS increased hippocampal mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1α) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which are master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, both in SAMR1 and SAMP8 at 13 months of age. Furthermore, mRNAs for nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory complex enzymes, but not mitochondrial DNA itself, were increased by SGS in SAMP8 mice. These results suggest that SGS prevents age-related cognitive decline by maintaining mitochondrial function in senescence-accelerated mice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), classified as the most harmful type of DNA damage based on the complexity of repair, lead to apoptosis or tumorigenesis. In aging, DNA damage increases and DNA repair decreases. This is exacerbated in disease, as post-mortem tissue from patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) show increased DSBs. A novel role for DSBs in immediate early gene (IEG) expression, learning, and memory has been suggested. Inducing neuronal activity leads to increases in DSBs and upregulation of IEGs, while increasing DSBs and inhibiting DSB repair impairs long-term memory and alters IEG expression. Consistent with this pattern, mice carrying dominant AD mutations have increased baseline DSBs, and impaired DSB repair is observed. These data suggest an adaptive role for DSBs in the central nervous system and dysregulation of DSBs and/or repair might drive age-related cognitive decline (ACD), MCI, and AD. In this review, we discuss the adaptive role of DSBs in hippocampus-dependent learning, memory, and IEG expression. We summarize IEGs, the history of DSBs, and DSBs in synaptic plasticity, aging, and AD. DSBs likely have adaptive functions in the brain, and even subtle alterations in their formation and repair could alter IEGs, learning, and memory.\",\n",

A 174 Gy MRT SIB was administered with an array of quasi-parallel, 50 µm wide microbeams spaced at a centre-to-centre distance of 400 µm either on the first or last day of a 5 × 4 Gy radiotherapy schedule in healthy adult C57 BL/6J mice and in F98 glioma cell cultures. The animals were observed for signs of intracranial pressure and focal neurologic signs. Colony counts were conducted in F98 glioma cell cultures. No signs of acute adverse effects were observed in any of the irradiated animals within 3 days after the last irradiation fraction. The tumoricidal effect on F98 cell in vitro was higher when the MRT boost was delivered on the first day of the irradiation course, as opposed to the last day. Therefore, the MRT SIB should be integrated into a clinical radiotherapy schedule as early as possible.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Adropin is a novel 76-amino acid-peptide that is expressed in different tissues and cells including the liver, pancreas, heart and vascular tissues, kidney, milk, serum, plasma and many parts of the brain. Adropin, encoded by the  gene, plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis. The literature review indicates that adropin alleviates the degree of insulin resistance by reducing endogenous hepatic glucose production. Adropin improves glucose metabolism by enhancing glucose utilization in mice, including the sensitization of insulin signaling pathways such as Akt phosphorylation and the activation of the glucose transporter 4 receptor. Several studies have also demonstrated that adropin improves cardiac function, cardiac efficiency and coronary blood flow in mice. Adropin can also reduce the levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, it increases the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, often referred to as the beneficial cholesterol. Adropin inhibits inflammation by reducing the tissue level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. The protective effect of adropin on the vascular endothelium is through an increase in the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. This article provides an overview of the existing literature about the role of adropin in different pathological conditions.',\n",

Recent evidence that the prion-like propagation of α-synuclein (α-syn), as a major component of LBs and LNs, plays an important role in the progression of PD has gained much attention, although the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated whether neuronal ApoE regulates the cell-to-cell transmission of α-syn and explored its molecular mechanism using in vitro and in vivo model systems. We demonstrate that neuronal ApoE deficiency attenuates both α-syn uptake and release by downregulating LRP-1 and LDLR expression and enhancing chaperone-mediated autophagy activity, respectively, thereby contributing to α-syn propagation. In addition, we observed that α-syn propagation was attenuated in ApoE knockout mice injected with pre-formed mouse α-syn fibrils. This study will help our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying α-syn propagation.\",\n",

Excessive high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, which is very common among adolescents, has long been recognized as a potent risk factor for multiple mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the influences of HFD consumption in adolescence on emotional health are far from clear. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (CD) or HFD for about 4 weeks from postnatal day (P) 28 to P60, spanning most of the adolescence period, and then subjected to behavioral assessments and histological examinations. HFD mice exhibited elevated levels of depression and anxiety, decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, and excessive microglial activation in the ventral hippocampus. Furthermore, in HFD-fed mice, microglia showed increased DCX inclusions, suggesting aberrant microglial engulfment of newborn neurons in HFD-fed adolescents. To our knowledge, this is the first observation suggesting that the negative effects of HFD consumption in adolescence on emotion and neuroplasticity may be attributed at least in part to aberrant microglial engulfment of nascent neurons, extending our understanding of the mechanism underlying HFD-related affective disorders in young people.',\n",

The creation of stable fluorescent glioma cell lines is a promising tool for in-depth studies of the molecular mechanisms of glioma initialization and pathogenesis, as well as for the development of new anti-cancer strategies. Herein, a new fluorescent glioma GL261-kat cell line stably expressing a far-red fluorescent protein (TurboFP635; Katushka) was generated and characterized, and then validated in a mouse orthotopic glioma model. By using epi-fluorescence imaging, we detect the fluorescent glioma GL261-kat cells in mice starting from day 14 after the inoculation of glioma cells, and the fluorescence signal intensity increases as the glioma progresses. Tumor growth is confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and histology. A gradual development of neurological deficit and behavioral alterations in mice is observed during glioma progression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the significance and feasibility of using the novel glioma GL261-kat cell line as a model of glioma biology, which can be used to study the initialization of glioma and monitor its growth by lifetime non-invasive tracking of glioma cells, with the prospect of monitoring the response to anti-cancer therapy.',\n",

In addition to highly proliferative and invasive properties, GB cells show cancer-associated metabolic characteristics such as increased aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a key enzyme complex at the crossroads between lactic fermentation and oxidative pathways, finely regulated by PDH kinases (PDHKs). PDHKs are often overexpressed in cancer cells to facilitate high glycolytic flux. We hypothesized that targeting PDHKs, by disturbing cancer metabolic homeostasis, would alter GB progression and render cells vulnerable to additional cancer treatment. Using patient databases, distinct expression patterns of PDHK1 and PDHK2 in GB tissues were obvious. To disturb protumoral glycolysis, we modulated PDH activity through the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PDHK in patient-derived stem-like spheroids. Striking effects of PDHKs inhibition using dichloroacetate were observed in vitro on cell morphology and metabolism, resulting in increased intracellular ROS levels and decreased proliferation and invasion. In vivo findings confirmed a reduction in tumor size and better survival of mice implanted with PDHK1 and PDHK2 knockout cells. Adding a radiotherapeutic protocol further resulted in a reduction in tumor size and improved mouse survival in our model.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain and retina and lacks reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. As amyloid beta (Aβ) manifestations emerge prior to clinical symptoms and plaques of amyloid may cause vascular damage, identification of retinal vascular biomarkers may improve knowledge of AD pathophysiology and potentially serve as therapeutic targets. The purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that retinal hemodynamic and oxygen metrics are altered in 5XFAD mice. Thirty-two male mice were evaluated at 3 months of age: sixteen 5XFAD transgenic and sixteen wild-type mice. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, vascular oxygen tension, and blood flow imaging were performed in one eye of each mouse. After imaging, the imaged and fellow retinal tissues were submitted for histological sectioning and amyloid protein analysis, respectively. Protein analysis was also performed on the brain tissues. Retinal physiological changes in venous diameter and blood velocity, arterial and venous oxygen contents, coupled with anatomical alterations in the thickness of retinal cell layers were detected in 5XFAD mice. Moreover, an increase in Aβ42 levels in both the retina and brain tissues was observed in 5XFAD mice. Significant changes in retinal oxygen delivery, metabolism, or extraction fraction were not detected. Based on compiled data from both groups, arterial oxygen content was inversely related to venous blood velocity and nerve fiber/ganglion cell layer thickness. Concurrent alterations in retinal hemodynamic and oxygen metrics, thickness, and tissue Aβ42 protein levels in 5XFAD mice at 3 months of age corresponded to previously reported findings in human AD. Overall, these results suggest that this mouse model can be utilized for studying pathophysiology of AD and evaluating potential therapies. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Serotonin receptor 5-HT and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) strongly contribute to neuroplasticity regulation and are implicated in numerous neuronal disorders. Here, we demonstrate a physical interaction between 5-HT and TrkB in vitro and in vivo using co-immunoprecipitation and biophysical and biochemical approaches. Heterodimerization decreased TrkB autophosphorylation, preventing its activation with agonist 7,8-DHF, even with low 5-HT receptor expression. A blockade of 5-HT receptor with the preferential antagonist ketanserin prevented the receptor-mediated downregulation of TrkB phosphorylation without restoring the TrkB response to its agonist 7,8-DHF in vitro. In adult mice, intraperitoneal ketanserin injection increased basal TrkB phosphorylation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which is in accordance with our findings demonstrating the prevalence of 5-HT-TrkB heteroreceptor complexes in these brain regions. An expression analysis revealed strong developmental regulation of 5-HT and TrkB expressions in the cortex, hippocampus, and especially the striatum, demonstrating that the balance between TrkB and 5-HT may shift in certain brain regions during postnatal development. Our data reveal the functional role of 5-HT-TrkB receptor heterodimerization and suggest that the regulated expression of 5-HT and TrkB is a molecular mechanism for the brain-region-specific modulation of TrkB functions during development and under pathophysiological conditions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Structural plasticity in the brain often necessitates dramatic remodeling of neuronal processes, with attendant reorganization of the cytoskeleton and membranes. Although cytoskeletal restructuring has been studied extensively, how lipids might orchestrate structural plasticity remains unclear. We show that specific glial cells in Drosophila produce glucocerebrosidase (GBA) to locally catabolize sphingolipids. Sphingolipid accumulation drives lysosomal dysfunction, causing gba1b mutants to harbor protein aggregates that cycle across circadian time and are regulated by neural activity, the circadian clock, and sleep. Although the vast majority of membrane lipids are stable across the day, a specific subset that is highly enriched in sphingolipids cycles daily in a gba1b-dependent fashion. Remarkably, both sphingolipid biosynthesis and degradation are required for the diurnal remodeling of circadian clock neurites, which grow and shrink across the day. Thus, dynamic sphingolipid regulation by glia enables diurnal circuit remodeling and proper circadian behavior.',\n",

Despite remarkable progress in miniature electronics for less invasive neurostimulation, most nano-enabled, optically triggered interfaces are demonstrated in cultured cells, which precludes the studies of natural neural circuits. We exploit here free-standing silicon-based nanoscale photodiodes to optically modulate single, identified neurons in mammalian spinal cord explants. With near-infrared light stimulation, we show that activating single excitatory or inhibitory neurons differently affects sensory circuits processing in the dorsal horn. We successfully functionalize nano-photodiodes to target single molecules, such as glutamate AMPA receptor subunits, thus enabling light activation of specific synaptic pathways. We conclude that nano-enabled neural interfaces can modulate selected sensory networks with low invasiveness. The use of nanoscale photodiodes can thus provide original perspective in linking neural activity to specific behavioral outcome.',\n",

Although recent studies have revealed that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are involved in olfactory associative learning and memory, the potential neural circuit is not clearly dissected yet. Here, using an anterograde monosynaptic tracing strategy, we revealed that BFCNs in different subregions projected to many brain areas, but with significant differentiations. Our rabies virus retrograde tracing results found that the dorsal HIP (dHIP) received heavy projections from the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB), magnocellular preoptic nucleus (MCPO), and substantia innominate (SI) brain regions, which are known as the HMS complex (HMSc). Functionally, fiber photometry showed that cholinergic neurons in the HMSc were significantly activated in odor-cued go/no-go discrimination tasks. Moreover, specific depletion of the HMSc cholinergic neurons innervating the dHIP significantly decreased the performance accuracies in odor-cued go/no-go discrimination tasks. Taken together, these studies provided detailed information about the projections of different BFCN subpopulations and revealed that the HMSc-dHIP cholinergic circuit plays a crucial role in regulating olfactory associative learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Early life stress (ELS) is an important factor in programing the brain for future response to stress, and resilience or vulnerability to stress-induced emotional disorders. The hippocampal formation, with essential roles in both regulating the stress circuitry and emotionality, contributes to this adaptive programing. Here, we examined the effects of early handling (EH) and maternal deprivation (MD) as mild and intense postnatal stressors, respectively, on the behavioural responses to social defeat stress in young adulthood. We also evaluated the interaction of mild and intense ELS with later social defeat (SD) stress on the morphology and dendritic spine density of Golgi-cox-stained CA3 hippocampal neurons. SD stress in adult rats, as expected, increased anxiety and depressive-like behaviours in the open field, elevated plus-maze and forced swimming test. These effects were associated with reduction of dendritic spines and soma size of CA3 neurons. Both behavioural and structural alterations were significantly ameliorated in socially defeated rats that experienced early handling (EH-SD). Basal dendrites of CA3 neurons in EH-SD rats also showed longer dendrites and more intersections with Sholl circles in the distal portion, compared to both control and SD rats. On the other hand, in socially defeated rats with maternal deprivation experience (MD-SD) the stress-induced behavioural and structural alterations were generally intensified compared to SD rats. In MD-SD rats, apical dendrites of CA3 neurons demonstrated remarkable retraction; an effect that was not detected in SD rats. The reduction of dendritic spines density on the apical dendrites of CA3 neurons was also more pronounced in MD-SD rats compared to SD rats. Dendritic arbors and spines comprise the major neuronal substrate for the circuit connectivity, and cell region-specific alterations of dendrites and spines in CA3 neurons reveal plausible mechanisms that can underlie the impact of different ELSs on risk for affective disorders in response to social stress in adulthood.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The neuronal-specific SNORD115 has gathered interest because its deficiency may contribute to the pathophysiology of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), possibly by altering post-transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the serotonin (HTR2C) receptor. Yet, Snord115-KO mice do not resume the main symptoms of PWS and only subtle altered A-to-I RNA editing of Htr2c mRNAs were uncovered. Because HTR2C signaling fine-tunes the activity of monoaminergic neurons, we addressed the hypothesis that lack of Snord115 alters monoaminergic systems. We first showed that Snord115 was expressed in both monoaminergic and non-monoaminergic cells of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) harboring cell bodies of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, respectively. Measuring the tissue level of monoamines and metabolites, we found very few differences except that the content of homovanillic acid-a metabolite of dopamine-was decreased in the orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex of Snord115-KO mice. The latter effects were, however, associated with a few changes of monoamine tissue content connectivity across the 12 sampled brain regions. Using in vivo single cell extracellular recordings, we reported that the firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons and DRN serotonergic neurons was significantly increased in Snord115-KO mice. These neural circuit dysfunctions were not, however, associated with apparent defects in binge eating, conditioned place preference to cocaine, cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion or compulsive behavior. Altogether, our multiscale study shows that the absence of Snord115 impacts on central monoaminergic circuits to an extent that does not elicit gross behavioral abnormalities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human prefrontal cortex (hPFC) is a complex brain region involved in cognitive and emotional processes and several psychiatric disorders. Here, we present an overview of the distribution of the peptidergic systems in 17 subregions of hPFC and three reference cortices obtained by microdissection and based on RNA sequencing and RNAscope methods integrated with published single-cell transcriptomics data. We detected expression of 60 neuropeptides and 60 neuropeptide receptors in at least one of the hPFC subregions. The results reveal that the peptidergic landscape in PFC consists of closely located and functionally different subregions with unique peptide/transmitter-related profiles. Neuropeptide-rich PFC subregions were identified, encompassing regions from anterior cingulate cortex/orbitofrontal gyrus. Furthermore, marked differences in gene expression exist between different PFC regions (>5-fold; cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide) as well as between PFC regions and reference regions, for example, for somatostatin and several receptors. We suggest that the present approach allows definition of, still hypothetical, microcircuits exemplified by glutamatergic neurons expressing a peptide cotransmitter either as an agonist (hypocretin/orexin) or antagonist (galanin). Specific neuropeptide receptors have been identified as possible targets for neuronal afferents and, interestingly, peripheral blood-borne peptide hormones (leptin, adiponectin, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon-like peptides, and peptide YY). Together with other recent publications, our results support the view that neuropeptide systems may play an important role in hPFC and underpin the concept that neuropeptide signaling helps stabilize circuit connectivity and fine-tune/modulate PFC functions executed during health and disease.',\n",

In particular, it is unclear whether learning engages specific GABAergic interneurons and, if so, whether they differ functionally from interneurons recruited by other experiences. Here, we show that fear conditioning activates a heterogeneous neuronal population in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that is largely comprised of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs). Using intersectional genetic approaches, we demonstrate that fear-learning-activated SST-INs exhibit distinct circuit properties and are selectively reactivated to mediate cue-evoked memory expression. In contrast, an orthogonal population of SST-INs activated by morphine experience exerts opposing control over fear and supports reward-like motivational effects. These results outline an important role for discrete subsets of GABAergic cells in emotional learning and point to an unappreciated capacity for functional specialization among SST-INs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuromodulators regulate neuronal excitability and bias neural circuit outputs. Optical recording of neuronal Ca transients is a powerful approach to study the impact of neuromodulators on neural circuit dynamics. We are investigating the polymodal nociceptor ASH in  to better understand the relationship between neuronal excitability and optically recorded Ca transients. ASHs depolarize in response to the aversive olfactory stimulus 1-octanol (1-oct) with a concomitant rise in somal Ca, stimulating an aversive locomotory response. Serotonin (5-HT) potentiates 1-oct avoidance through Gα signaling, which inhibits L-type voltage-gated Ca channels in ASH. Although Ca signals in the ASH soma decrease, depolarization amplitudes increase because Ca mediates inhibitory feedback control of membrane potential in this context. Here, we investigate octopamine (OA) signaling in ASH to assess whether this negative correlation between somal Ca and depolarization amplitudes is a general phenomenon, or characteristic of certain neuromodulatory pathways. Like 5-HT, OA reduces somal Ca transient amplitudes in ASH neurons. However, OA antagonizes 5-HT modulation of 1-oct avoidance behavior, suggesting that OA may signal through a different pathway. We further show that the pathway for OA diminution of ASH somal Ca consists of the OCTR-1 receptor, the G heterotrimeric G-protein, and the G-protein activated inwardly rectifying channels IRK-2 and IRK-3, and this pathway reduces depolarization amplitudes in parallel with somal Ca transient amplitudes. Therefore, even within a single neuron, somal Ca signal reduction may indicate either increased or decreased depolarization amplitude, depending on which neuromodulatory signaling pathways are activated, underscoring the need for careful interpretation of Ca imaging data in neuromodulatory studies.',\n",

Nonetheless, neurons entail large variability in the expression levels of VGICs and their corresponding intrinsic properties, but the role of this variability in information transfer is not fully known. In this study, we aimed to investigate how this variability of VGICs affects information transfer. For this, we used a previously derived population of neuronal model neurons, each with the variable expression of five types of VGICs, fast Na, delayed rectifier K, A-type K, T-type Ca, and HCN channels. These analyses showed that the model neurons displayed variability in mutual information transfer, measured as the capability of neurons to successfully encode incoming synaptic information in output firing frequencies. Likewise, variability in the expression of VGICs caused variability in EPSPs and IPSPs amplitudes, reflected in the variability of output firing frequencies. Finally, using the virtual knockout methodology, we show that among the ion channels tested, the A-type K channel is the major regulator of information processing and transfer.',\n",

Unfortunately, although has been widely investigated, the mechanism comprehension around tDCS effects presents still some gaps. Therefore, scientists are still trying to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind its positive effects to permit a more suitable application. Experimental models have provided converging evidence that tDCS elicits improvements in learning and memory by modulating both excitability and synaptic plasticity in neurons. Recently, among tDCS neurobiological effects, neural synchronization and dendritic structural changes have been reported in physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting possible effects at the neuronal circuit level. In this review, we bring in to focus the emerging effects of tDCS on the structural plasticity changes and neuronal rewiring, with the intent to match these two aspects with the underpinning molecular mechanisms identified so far, providing a new perspective to work on to unveil novel tDCS therapeutic use to treat brain dysfunctions.',\n",

During development, sensory deprivation evokes powerful synaptic plasticity that alters circuitry, but how different inhibitory subtypes modulate circuit dynamics in response to this plasticity remains unclear. We investigate how deprivation-induced synaptic changes affect excitatory and inhibitory firing rates in a microcircuit model of the sensory cortex with multiple interneuron subtypes. We find that with a single interneuron subtype (parvalbumin-expressing [PV]), excitatory and inhibitory firing rates can only be comodulated-increased or decreased together. To explain the experimentally observed independent modulation, whereby one firing rate increases and the other decreases, requires strong feedback from a second interneuron subtype (somatostatin-expressing [SST]). Our model applies to the visual and somatosensory cortex, suggesting a general mechanism across sensory cortices. Therefore, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the differential role of interneuron subtypes in regulating firing rates, contributing to the already diverse roles they serve in the cortex.',\n",

Among the patients, aberrant and asymmetric activation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) is reported in some clinical cases. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of lOFC activation in extinction acquisition and explore the potential functional lateralization of lOFC on extinction. We bilaterally or unilaterally activated the lOFC with N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) before fear extinction acquisition in rats. Our data suggested that both left and bilateral lOFC activation interfered with the in-session expression of conditioned fear, whereas activation of the right lOFC did not. In addition, pre-extinction unilateral or bilateral activation of the lOFC, regardless of the side, impaired the acquisition of fear extinction. We also quantified the neuronal activities during the late phase of extinction with immunohistochemical approach. Our data showed that activation of the lOFC increased the neuronal activities on the injection side(s) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the lateral amygdala (LA), the basolateral amygdala (BLA; preferentially the non-GABAergic neurons), and the medial intercalated cells (mITC; preferentially the right side). To conclude, aberrant activation of the lOFC during extinction disturbed the excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal activities in fear-related brain regions, which interfered with the expression of conditioned fear and impaired the acquisition of fear extinction.',\n",

We found that, in both species, the regulatory strategies controlling early and late stages of pan-neuronal development diverge. Early postmitotic neurons use more widely shared and evolutionarily conserved molecular regulatory programs. In contrast, programs active during later neuronal maturation are more brain- and neuron-specific and more evolutionarily divergent.

The study of networks has uncovered common principles that underlie the behavior of vastly different fields of study, including physics, biology, sociology, and engineering. One of these common principles is the existence of network motifs-small recurrent patterns that can provide certain features that are important for the specific network. However, it remains unclear how network motifs are joined in real networks to make larger circuits and what properties emerge from interactions between network motifs. Here, we develop a framework to explore the mesoscale-level behavior of complex networks. Considering network motifs as hypernodes, we define the rules for their interaction at the network's next level of organization. We develop a method to infer the favorable arrangements of interactions between network motifs into hypermotifs from real evolved and designed network data. We mathematically explore the emergent properties of these higher-order circuits and their relations to the properties of the individual minimal circuit components they combine. We apply this framework to biological, neuronal, social, linguistic, and electronic networks and find that network motifs are not randomly distributed in real networks but are combined in a way that both maintains autonomy and generates emergent properties. This framework provides a basis for exploring the mesoscale structure and behavior of complex systems where it can be used to reveal intermediate patterns in complex networks and to identify specific nodes and links in the network that are the key drivers of the network's emergent properties.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"During spatial exploration, neural circuits in the hippocampus store memories of sequences of sensory events encountered in the environment. When sensory information is absent during 'offline' resting periods, brief neuronal population bursts can 'replay' sequences of activity that resemble bouts of sensory experience. These sequences can occur in either forward or reverse order, and can even include spatial trajectories that have not been experienced, but are consistent with the topology of the environment. The neural circuit mechanisms underlying this variable and flexible sequence generation are unknown. Here we demonstrate in a recurrent spiking network model of hippocampal area CA3 that experimental constraints on network dynamics such as population sparsity, stimulus selectivity, rhythmicity and spike rate adaptation, as well as associative synaptic connectivity, enable additional emergent properties, including variable offline memory replay. In an online stimulus-driven state, we observed the emergence of neuronal sequences that swept from representations of past to future stimuli on the timescale of the theta rhythm. In an offline state driven only by noise, the network generated both forward and reverse neuronal sequences, and recapitulated the experimental observation that offline memory replay events tend to include salient locations like the site of a reward. These results demonstrate that biological constraints on the dynamics of recurrent neural circuits are sufficient to enable memories of sensory events stored in the strengths of synaptic connections to be flexibly read out during rest and sleep, which is thought to be important for memory consolidation and planning of future behaviour. KEY POINTS: A recurrent spiking network model of hippocampal area CA3 was optimized to recapitulate experimentally observed network dynamics during simulated spatial exploration. During simulated offline rest, the network exhibited the emergent property of generating flexible forward, reverse and mixed direction memory replay events. Network perturbations and analysis of model diversity and degeneracy identified associative synaptic connectivity and key features of network dynamics as important for offline sequence generation. Network simulations demonstrate that population over-representation of salient positions like the site of reward results in biased memory replay.\",\n",

Prenatal VPA exposure has been reported to affect neurogenesis and neuronal migration and differentiation. In addition, growing evidence has shown that microglia and brain immune cells are activated by VPA treatment. However, the role of VPA-activated microglia remains unclear. Pregnant female mice received sodium valproate on E11.5. A microglial activation inhibitor, minocycline or a CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc was dissolved in drinking water and administered to dams from P1 to P21. Measurement of microglial activity, evaluation of neural circuit function and expression analysis were performed on P10. Behavioral tests were performed in the order of open field test, Y-maze test, social affiliation test and marble burying test from the age of 6\\xa0weeks. Prenatal exposure of mice to VPA induced microglial activation and neural circuit dysfunction in the CA1 region of the hippocampus during the early postnatal periods and post-developmental defects in working memory and social interaction and repetitive behaviors. Minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor, clearly suppressed the above effects, suggesting that microglia elicit neural dysfunction and behavioral disorders. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of a chemokine, C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), was upregulated in the hippocampi of VPA-treated mice. CCL3 expression increased in microglia during the early postnatal periods via an epigenetic mechanism. The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc significantly suppressed neural circuit dysfunction and post-developmental behavioral disorders induced by prenatal VPA exposure. These findings suggest that microglial CCL3 might act during development to contribute to VPA-induced post-developmental behavioral abnormalities. CCR5-targeting compounds such as maraviroc might alleviate behavioral disorders when administered early. ',\n",

It was described by the Austrian paediatrician Ernst Moro (1874-1951) in 1918, although the earliest visual representation of the MR dates back to the first half of the 14th\\xa0Century, in a fresco by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (1290-1348). The neural centre underlying the MR is located in the lower part of the brainstem since it can be elicited also in anencephalic infants, as shown by the Austrian neurologist Eduard Gamper (1887-1938) in the first medical description of anencephaly (1926). The MR is due to the activation of an archaic neural circuit present in the newborn, the activity of which is later inhibited by the upper brain structures. Given their semiological resemblance, epileptic spasms and generalized tonic-clonic seizures might be due (at least partly) to the pathological activation of the same neural archaic circuit involved in the genesis of the MR. The neuronal network underlying these different phenomena might be located in the pons. In these seizure types, the activation of the same neural circuitry involved in the MR could occur through either direct excitation or through an indirect \"liberating\" mechanism, secondary to epileptic disruption of cortical inhibitory control on subcortical structures. The movements of the upper extremities in epileptic spasms, in the initial phase of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and the MR might involve a distinct neural circuitry, which is (or becomes) hyperexcitable as a consequence of a pathological condition (epilepsy) or physiological brain immaturity (the MR).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'calcium imaging is a standard neuroimaging technique that allows selective observation of target neuronal activities. In calcium imaging, neuron activation signals provide key information for the investigation of neural circuits. For efficient extraction of the calcium signals of neurons, selective detection of the region of interest (ROI) pixels corresponding to the active subcellular region of the target neuron is essential. However, current ROI detection methods for calcium imaging data exhibit a relatively low signal extraction performance from neurons with a low signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR). This is problematic because a low SNR is unavoidable in many biological experiments.Therefore, we propose an iterative correlation-based ROI detection (ICoRD) method that robustly extracts the calcium signal of the target neuron from a calcium imaging series with severe noise.ICoRD extracts calcium signals closer to the ground-truth calcium signal than the conventional method from simulated calcium imaging data in all low SNR ranges.

However, the biological principles of spine reorganization during learning remain elusive because the identity of their presynaptic neuronal partners is unknown. Here, we show that two presynaptic neural circuits supervise distinct programs of spine dynamics to execute learning. We imaged spine dynamics in motor cortex during learning and performed post hoc identification of their afferent presynaptic neurons. New spines that appeared during learning formed small transient contacts with corticocortical neurons that were eliminated on skill acquisition. In contrast, persistent spines with axons from thalamic neurons were formed and enlarged. These results suggest that pyramidal cell dendrites in motor cortex use a neural circuit division of labor during skill learning, with dynamic teaching contacts from top-down intracortical axons followed by synaptic memory formation driven by thalamic axons. Dual spine supervision may govern diverse skill learning in the neocortex.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The assembly of complex neural circuits requires that stem cells generate diverse types of neurons in the correct temporal order. Pioneering work in the Drosophila embryonic ventral nerve cord has shown that neural stem cells are temporally patterned by the sequential expression of rapidly changing transcription factors to generate diversity in their progeny. In recent years, a second temporal patterning mechanism, driven by the opposing gradients of the Imp and Syp RNA-binding proteins, has emerged as a powerful way to generate neural diversity. This long-range temporal patterning mechanism is utilized in the extended neural stem cell lineages of the postembryonic fly brain. Here, we review the role played by Imp and Syp gradients in several neural stem cell lineages, focusing on how they specify sequential neural fates through the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes, including the Chinmo and Mamo transcription factors. We further discuss how upstream inputs, including hormonal signals, modify the output of these gradients to couple neurogenesis with the development of the organism. Finally, we review the roles that the Imp and Syp gradients play beyond the generation of diversity, including the regulation of stem cell proliferation, the timing of neural stem cell lineage termination, and the coupling of neuronal birth order to circuit assembly.',\n",

It is therefore important to identify mathematical principles that can be used to develop testable hypotheses. In this study, we use ideas and concepts from systems biology to study the dopamine system, which controls learning, motivation, and movement. Using data from neuronal recordings in behavioral experiments, we developed a mathematical model for dopamine responses and the effect of dopamine on movement. We show that the dopamine system shares core functional analogies with bacterial chemotaxis. Just as chemotaxis robustly climbs chemical attractant gradients, the dopamine circuit performs 'reward-taxis' where the attractant is the expected value of reward. The reward-taxis mechanism provides a simple explanation for scale-invariant dopaminergic responses and for matching in free operant settings, and makes testable quantitative predictions. We propose that reward-taxis is a simple and robust navigation strategy that complements other, more goal-directed navigation mechanisms.\",\n",

FMRP loss or dysfunction leads to aberrant neuronal and synaptic activities in fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is characterized by intellectual disability, sensory abnormalities, and social communication problems. Studies of FMRP function and FXS pathogenesis have primarily been conducted with Fmr1 (the gene encoding FMRP) knockout in transgenic animals. Here we report an in vivo method for determining the cell-autonomous function of FMRP during the period of circuit assembly and synaptic formation using chicken embryos. This method employs stage-, site-, and direction-specific electroporation of a drug-inducible vector system containing Fmr1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and an EGFP reporter. With this method, we achieved selective FMRP knockdown in the auditory ganglion (AG) and in one of its brainstem targets, the nucleus magnocellularis (NM), thus providing a component-specific manipulation within the AG-NM circuit. Additionally, the mosaic pattern of the transfection allows within-animal controls and neighboring neuron/fiber comparisons for enhanced reliability and sensitivity in data analyzing. The inducible vector system provides temporal control of gene editing onset to minimize accumulating developmental effects. The combination of these strategies provides an innovative tool to dissect the cell-autonomous function of FMRP in synaptic and circuit development.',\n",

Recent studies have revealed the differential gene expression and functional heterogeneity of microglia in different brain regions. The unique functions of the hippocampal neural network in learning and memory may be associated with the active roles of microglia in synapse remodeling. However, inflammatory responses induced by surgical procedures have been problematic in the two-photon microscopic analysis of hippocampal microglia. Here, a method is presented that enables the chronic observation of microglia in all layers of the hippocampal CA1 through an imaging window. This method allows the analysis of morphological changes in microglial processes for more than 1 month. Long-term and high-resolution imaging of the resting microglia requires minimally invasive surgical procedures, appropriate objective lens selection, and optimized imaging techniques. The transient inflammatory response of hippocampal microglia may prevent imaging immediately after surgery, but the microglia restore their quiescent morphology within a few weeks. Furthermore, imaging neurons simultaneously with microglia allows us to analyze the interactions of multiple cell types in the hippocampus. This technique may provide essential information about microglial function in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) imbalance has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. GABA neurotransmission, the principal inhibitory signal in the mature brain, is critically coupled to proper regulation of chloride homeostasis. During brain maturation, changes in the transport of chloride ions across neuronal cell membranes act to gradually change the majority of GABA signaling from excitatory to inhibitory for neuronal activation, and dysregulation of this GABA-shift likely contributes to multiple neurodevelopmental abnormalities that are associated with circuit dysfunction. Whilst traditionally viewed as a phenomenon which occurs during brain development, recent evidence suggests that this GABA-shift may also be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders due to the \"dematuration\" of affected neurons. In this review, we will discuss the cell signaling and regulatory mechanisms underlying the GABA-shift phenomenon in the context of the latest findings in the field, in particular the role of chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2, and furthermore how these regulatory processes are altered in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We will also explore the interactions between GABAergic interneurons and other cell types in the developing brain that may influence the GABA-shift. Finally, with a greater understanding of how the GABA-shift is altered in pathological conditions, we will briefly outline recent progress on targeting NKCC1 and KCC2 as a therapeutic strategy against neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with improper chloride homeostasis and GABA-shift abnormalities.',\n",

However, the mechanisms underlying temperature-coordinated feeding behavior are rarely reported. Here we find that a non-canonical feeding center, the anteroventral and periventricular portions of medial preoptic area (apMPOA) respond to altered dietary states in mice. Two neighboring but distinct neuronal populations in apMPOA mediate feeding behavior by receiving anatomical inputs from external and dorsal subnuclei of lateral parabrachial nucleus. While both populations are glutamatergic, the arcuate nucleus-projecting neurons in apMPOA can sense low temperature and promote food intake. The other type, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH)-projecting neurons in apMPOA are primarily sensitive to high temperature and suppress food intake. Caspase ablation or chemogenetic inhibition of the apMPOA→PVH pathway can eliminate the temperature dependence of feeding. Further projection-specific RNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization identify that the two neuronal populations are molecularly marked by galanin receptor and apelin receptor. These findings reveal unrecognized cell populations and circuits of apMPOA that orchestrates feeding behavior against thermal challenges.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Synapses are the site of communication between neurons. Neuronal circuit strength is related to synaptic density, and the breakdown of synapses is characteristic of disease states like major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease. Traditional techniques to investigate synapse numbers include genetic expression of fluorescent markers (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP)), dyes that fill a neuron (e.g., carbocyanine dye, DiI), and immunofluorescent detection of spine markers (e.g., postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95)). A major caveat to these proxy techniques is that they only identify postsynaptic changes. Yet, a synapse is a connection between a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic spine. The gold standard for measuring synapse formation/elimination requires time-consuming electron microscopy or array tomography techniques. These techniques require specialized training and costly equipment. Further, only a limited number of neurons can be assessed and are used to represent changes to an entire brain region. DetectSyn is a rapid fluorescent technique that identifies changes to synapse formation or elimination due to a disease state or drug activity. DetectSyn utilizes a rapid proximity ligation assay to detect juxtaposed pre- and postsynaptic proteins and standard fluorescent microscopy, a technique readily available to most laboratories. Fluorescent detection of the resulting puncta allows for quick and unbiased analysis of experiments. DetectSyn provides more representative results than electron microscopy because larger areas can be analyzed than a limited number of fluorescent neurons. Moreover, DetectSyn works for in vitro cultured neurons and fixed tissue slices. Finally, a method is provided to analyze the data collected from this technique. Overall, DetectSyn offers a procedure for detecting relative changes in synapse density across treatments or disease states and is more accessible than traditional techniques.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nicotine is a psychoactive component of tobacco that plays critical roles in the regulation of neuronal circuit function and neuroplasticity and contributes to the improvement of working memory performance and motor learning function  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Under  conditions, nicotine enhances facial stimulation-evoked mossy fiber-granule cell (MF-GrC) synaptic transmission, which suggests that nicotine regulates MF-GrC synaptic plasticity in the mouse cerebellar cortex. In this study, we investigated the effects of nicotine on facial stimulation-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of MF-GrC synaptic transmission in urethane-anesthetized mice. Our results showed that facial stimulation at 20 Hz induced an MF-GrC LTP in the mouse cerebellar granular layer that was significantly enhanced by the application of nicotine (1 μM). Blockade of α4β2 nAChRs, but not α7 nAChRs, during delivery of 20 Hz facial stimulation prevented the nicotine-induced facilitation of MF-GrC LTP. Notably, the facial stimulation-induced MF-GrC LTP was abolished by an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, but it was restored by additional application of nicotine during delivery of 20 Hz facial stimulation. Furthermore, antagonism of α4β2 nAChRs, but not α7 nAChRs, during delivery of 20 Hz facial stimulation prevented nicotine-induced MF-GrC LTP. Moreover, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) abolished the facial stimulation-induced MF-GrC LTP, as well as the effect of nicotine on it. Our results indicated that 20 Hz facial stimulation induced MF-GrC LTP  an NMDA receptor/nitric oxide (NO) cascade, but MF-GrC LTP was enhanced by nicotine through the α4β2 AChR/NO signaling pathway. These results suggest that nicotine-induced facilitation of MF-GrC LTP may play a critical role in the improvement of working memory performance and motor learning function.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The coordination of swallowing with breathing, in particular inspiration, is essential for homeostasis in most organisms. While much has been learned about the neuronal network critical for inspiration in mammals, the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), little is known about how this network interacts with swallowing. Here we activate within the preBötC excitatory neurons (defined as  and  neurons) and inhibitory neurons (defined as  neurons) and inhibit and activate neurons defined by the transcription factor  to gain an understanding of the coordination between the preBötC and swallow behavior. We found that stimulating inhibitory preBötC neurons did not mimic the premature shutdown of inspiratory activity caused by water swallows, suggesting that swallow-induced suppression of inspiratory activity is not directly mediated by the inhibitory neurons in the preBötC. By contrast, stimulation of preBötC  neurons delayed laryngeal closure of the swallow sequence. Inhibition of  neurons increased laryngeal closure duration and stimulation of  neurons pushed swallow occurrence to later in the respiratory cycle, suggesting that excitatory neurons from the preBötC connect to the laryngeal motoneurons and contribute to the timing of swallowing. Interestingly, the delayed swallow sequence was also caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a model for sleep apnea, which is 1) known to destabilize inspiratory activity and 2) associated with dysphagia. This delay was not present when inhibiting Dbx1 neurons. We propose that a stable preBötC is essential for normal swallow pattern generation and disruption may contribute to the dysphagia seen in obstructive sleep apnea.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In similar states, neural circuits produce similar outputs across individuals despite substantial interindividual variability in neuronal ionic conductances and synapses. Circuit states are largely shaped by neuromodulators that tune ionic conductances. It is therefore possible that, in addition to producing flexible circuit output, neuromodulators also contribute to output similarity despite varying ion channel expression. We studied whether neuromodulation at saturating concentrations can increase the output similarity of a single identified neuron across individual animals. Using the LP neuron of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG), we compared the variability of  curves and rebound properties in the presence of neuropeptides. The two neuropeptides we used converge to activate the same target current, which increases neuronal excitability. Output variability was lower in the presence of the neuropeptides, regardless of whether the neuropeptides significantly changed the mean of the corresponding parameter or not. However, the addition of the second neuropeptide did not add further to the reduction of variability. With a family of computational LP-like models, we explored how increased excitability and target variability contribute to output similarity and found two mechanisms: Saturation of the responses and a differential increase in baseline activity. Saturation alone can reduce the interindividual variability only if the population shares a similar ceiling for the responses. In contrast, reduction of variability due to the increase in baseline activity is independent of ceiling effects.The activity of single neurons and neural circuits can be very similar across individuals even though the ionic currents underlying activity are variable. The mechanisms that compensate for the underlying variability and promote output similarity are poorly understood but may involve neuromodulation. Using an identified neuron, we show that neuropeptide modulation of excitability can reduce interindividual variability of response properties at a single-neuron level in two ways. First, the neuropeptide increases baseline excitability in a differential manner, resulting in similar response thresholds. Second, the neuropeptide increases excitability towards a shared saturation level, promoting similar maximal firing rates across individuals. Such tuning of neuronal excitability could be an important mechanism compensating for interindividual variability of ion channel expression.',\n",

We assessed the risk of bias, calculated Hedges' g meta-level effect sizes, and investigated small-study effects using funnel plots and Egger regression. Seven studies, comprising 396 patients with bipolar disorder and 404 healthy controls, were included in the meta-analysis.

Patients with bipolar disorder showed consistent reductions in 40-Hz ASSR evoked power (Hedges' g\\xa0=\\xa0-0.49; 95% confidence intervals [-0.67, -0.31]) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) (Hedges' g\\xa0=\\xa0-0.43; 95\\xa0%CI [-0.58, -0.29]) compared with healthy controls.

Whereas most of the actions of ATP at intestinal epithelia are thought to be mediated by metabotropic P2Y receptors, the role of ionotropic P2X receptors remains unclear. Consequently, we investigated the role of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors on ion transport across rat colonic epithelia by using BzATP, a potent agonist at P2X7 (and weak agonist at P2X4). Ussing chamber and Ca imaging experiments were performed on rat colonic epithelia, combined with P2X receptor expression studies. Ussing chamber experiments revealed that serosal BzATP induced a neuronally mediated increase in short-circuit current caused by Cl secretion. In contrast, the effect of mucosal BzATP was smaller, insensitive to tetrodotoxin and Cl -independent. When epithelia were basolaterally depolarized to measure currents across the apical membrane, BzATP stimulated a cation current consistent with the activation of apical nonselective cation channels. Experiments with isolated colonic crypts revealed a BzATP-induced increase in the cytosolic Ca concentration. Sensitivity to antagonists indicates stimulation of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors by serosal BzATP and of P2X7 receptors by mucosal BzATP. A similar pattern was observed with native ATP, which induced larger transepithelial currents in comparison to BzATP. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed the expression of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors in the colon localized in the epithelium and in submucosal ganglia. Epithelial and neuronal ionotropic P2X receptors are involved in the regulation of intestinal ion transport. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Resonance is defined as maximal response of a system to periodic inputs in a limited frequency band. Resonance may serve to optimize inter-neuronal communication, and has been observed at multiple levels of neuronal organization. However, it is unknown how neuronal resonance observed at the network level is generated and how network resonance depends on the properties of the network building blocks. Here, we first develop a metric for quantifying spike timing resonance in the presence of background noise, extending the notion of spiking resonance for in vivo experiments. Using conductance-based models, we find that network resonance can be inherited from resonances at other levels of organization, or be intrinsically generated by combining mechanisms across distinct levels. Resonance of membrane potential fluctuations, postsynaptic potentials, and single neuron spiking can each be generated independently of resonance at any other level and be propagated to the network level. At all levels of organization, interactions between processes that give rise to low- and high-pass filters generate the observed resonance. Intrinsic network resonance can be generated by the combination of filters belonging to different levels of organization. Inhibition-induced network resonance can emerge by inheritance from resonance of membrane potential fluctuations, and be sharpened by presynaptic high-pass filtering. Our results demonstrate a multiplicity of qualitatively different mechanisms that can generate resonance in neuronal systems, and provide analysis tools and a conceptual framework for the mechanistic investigation of network resonance in terms of circuit components, across levels of neuronal organization.',\n",

Thus, the current study evaluated the effect of perforant path fiber loss on neuronal activity in CA3 and layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) in relation to mnemonic similarity task performance. Expression of the immediate early gene  was quantified in rats that received a unilateral right hemisphere transection of the perforant path or sham surgery that cut the cortex but left the fibers intact. Behavior-related expression of  mRNA was measured to test the hypothesis that fiber loss leads to elevated activation of CA3 and LEC neurons, as previously observed in aged rats that were impaired on the mnemonic similarity task. Transection of perforant path fibers, which has previously been shown to lead to a decline in mnemonic similarity task performance, did not alter  expression.  expression in CA3, however, was correlated with task performance on the more difficult discrimination trials across both surgical groups.

It is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly and its incidence increases exponentially with age. Neuronal and synapse loss, key hallmarks of the disorder, are widely regarded to occur early during the onset of AD, and the extent of this loss closely correlates with the progression of cognitive decline and dysfunction of the underlying neuronal circuity. Nevertheless, the mechanisms driving neuronal and synapse loss during early AD remains poorly understood. This review focuses on Heme-binding protein 1 (HEBP1), a mitochondrial-associated protein that has recently emerged as an important mediator of neuronal cell death during early AD pathogenesis. Acting downstream of Aβ and heme, HEBP1-mediated apoptosis contributes to neuronal loss and neuronal circuit dysfunction. Deleting HEBP1 expression in neurons protects them from heme- and Aβ-induced apoptosis, both of which are mechanisms implicated in neurodegeneration. HEBP1 participates in heme metabolism and binds to heme to modulate mitochondrial dynamics vital to the maintenance of neural circuitry that is affected in AD. HEBP1 elevation is also associated with AGE/RAGE-related neuronal damage, further implicating its involvement in neuronal loss during early AD. Moreover, F2L, a cleavage product of HEBP1 modulates inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of HEBP1 in the disruption of neural circuits during early AD.\",\n",

The fly's directionally selective T4 and T5 neurons encode ON and OFF motion, respectively. Their axons terminate in one of the four retinotopic layers in the lobula plate, where each layer encodes one of the four directions of motion. Although the input circuitry of the directionally selective neurons has been studied in detail, the synaptic connectivity of circuits integrating T4/T5 motion signals is largely unknown. Here, we report a 3D electron microscopy reconstruction, wherein we comprehensively identified T4/T5's synaptic partners in the lobula plate, revealing a diverse set of new cell types and attributing new connectivity patterns to the known cell types. Our reconstruction explains how the ON- and OFF-motion pathways converge. T4 and T5 cells that project to the same layer connect to common synaptic partners and comprise a core motif together with bilayer interneurons, detailing the circuit basis for computing motion opponency. We discovered pathways that likely encode new directions of motion by integrating vertical and horizontal motion signals from upstream T4/T5 neurons. Finally, we identify substantial projections into the lobula, extending the known motion pathways and suggesting that directionally selective signals shape feature detection there. The circuits we describe enrich the anatomical basis for experimental and computations analyses of motion vision and bring us closer to understanding complete sensory-motor pathways.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chronic pain is a major public health problem that currently lacks effective treatment options. Here, a method that can modulate chronic pain-like behaviour induced by nerve injury in mice is described. By combining a transient nerve block to inhibit noxious afferent input from injured peripheral nerves, with concurrent activation of astrocytes in the somatosensory cortex (S1) by either low intensity transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or via the chemogenetic DREADD system, we could reverse allodynia-like behaviour previously established by partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL). Such activation of astrocytes initiated spine plasticity to reduce those synapses formed shortly after PSL. This reversal from allodynia-like behaviour persisted well beyond the active treatment period. Thus, our study demonstrates a robust and potentially translational approach for modulating pain, that capitalizes on the interplay between noxious afferents, sensitized central neuronal circuits, and astrocyte-activation induced synaptic plasticity.',\n",

Long-distance attraction and short-distance repulsion, for example, are rules that jointly set a preferred interanimal distance in swarms. However, little is known about their perceptual mechanisms and executive neural circuits. Here we trace the neuronal response to self-like biological motion, a visual trigger for affiliation in developing zebrafish. Unbiased activity mapping and targeted volumetric two-photon calcium imaging revealed 21 activity hotspots distributed throughout the brain as well as clustered biological-motion-tuned neurons in a multimodal, socially activated nucleus of the dorsal thalamus. Individual dorsal thalamus neurons encode local acceleration of visual stimuli mimicking typical fish kinetics but are insensitive to global or continuous motion. Electron microscopic reconstruction of dorsal thalamus neurons revealed synaptic input from the optic tectum and projections into hypothalamic areas with conserved social function. Ablation of the optic tectum or dorsal thalamus selectively disrupted social attraction without affecting short-distance repulsion. This tectothalamic pathway thus\\xa0serves visual recognition of conspecifics, and dissociates neuronal control of attraction from repulsion during social\\xa0affiliation, revealing a circuit underpinning collective behaviour.',\n",

In flies as in vertebrates, neuronal activity induces input-specific changes in the synaptic strength so that the entire circuit maintains stable function in the face of many challenges, including changes in synapse number and strength. But how do neurons sense synapse activity? In several studies carried out using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we demonstrated that local BMP signaling provides an exquisite sensor for synapse activity. Here we review the main features of this exquisite sensor and discuss its functioning beyond monitoring the synapse activity but rather as a key controller that operates in coordination with other BMP signaling pathways to balance synapse growth, maturation and function.',\n",

A major recent finding has been the identification of unusually richly connected hub cells that have capacity to synchronize networks and may also be critical in network dysfunction. While hub neurons are traditionally defined by measures that consider solely the number and strength of connections, novel higher-order graph analytics now enables the mining of massive networks for repeating subgraph patterns called motifs. As an illustration of the power offered by higher-order analysis of neuronal networks, we highlight how recent methodological advances uncovered a new functional cell type, the superhub, that is predicted to play a major role in regulating network dynamics.

       "  'abstract': 'Social recognition memory (SRM) is the ability to distinguish familiar from novel conspecifics and is crucial for survival and reproductive success across social species. We previously reported that oxytocin (OXT) receptor (OXTR) signaling in the CA2/CA3a of dorsal hippocampus is essential to promote the persistence of long-term SRM, yet how the endogenous OXT system influences CA2 outputs to regulate long-term SRM formation remains unclear. To achieve a selective deletion of CA2 OXTRs, we crossed Amigo2-Cre mice with Oxtr-floxed mice to generate CA2-specific Oxtr conditional knockout (Oxtr) mice. A three-chamber paradigm test was used for studying SRM in mice. Chemogenetic and optogenetic targeting strategies were employed to manipulate neuronal activity. We show that selective ablation of Oxtr in the CA2 suffices to impair the persistence of long-term SRM but has no effect on sociability and social novelty preference in the three-chamber paradigm test. We find that cell-type specific activation of OXT neurons within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus enhances long-term SRM and this enhancement is blocked by local application of OXTR antagonist L-368,899 into dorsal hippocampal CA2 (dCA2) region. In addition, chemogenetic neuronal silencing in dCA2 demonstrated that neuronal activity is essential for forming long-term SRM. Moreover, chemogenetic terminal-specific inactivation reveals a crucial role for dCA2 outputs to ventral CA1 (vCA1), but not dorsal lateral septum, in long-term SRM. Finally, targeted activation of the dCA2-to-vCA1 circuit effectively ameliorates long-term SRM deficit observed in Oxtr mice. These findings highlight the importance of hippocampal CA2 OXTR signaling in governing the persistence of long-term SRM and identify a hippocampal circuit linking dCA2 to vCA1 necessary for controlling long-term SRM formation.

The mechanisms of activation and response of microglia are diverse depending on the location within the spinal cord, type, severity, and proximity of injury, as well as the age and species of the organism. Thanks to recent advancements in neuro-immune research techniques, such as single-cell transcriptomics, novel genetic mouse models, and live imaging, a vast amount of literature has come to light regarding the mechanisms of microglial activation and alluding to the function of microgliosis around injured motoneurons and sensory afferents.

PTSD is characterized by acute and chronic stress response exhibit anxiety, fear, and an increased inflammatory etiology.

It is known that impairment of the neurological circuit leads to the development of PTSD. Evidence has suggested that dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and inflammatory responsiveness are pivotal and a greater risk in PTSD.

In this review, we provide relevant findings regarding NF-κB activity in various components of brain and describe a potential mechanism linking PTSD using preclinical and clinical models.

We recorded single-unit PFC activity while male monkeys () performed a task in which the category and rule were prerequisites of logical thinking and the outcome contingency was its consequence. Different groups of neurons coded a single type of information discretely or multiple types in a transitional form. Results of time-by-time analysis of neuronal activity suggest an information flow from category-coding and rule-coding neurons to transitional intermediate neurons, and then to contingency-coding neurons. Category-coding, rule-coding, and contingency-coding neurons showed stable coding of information, whereas intermediate neurons showed dynamic coding, as if it integrated category and rule to derive contingency. A similar process was confirmed by using a spiking neural network model that consisted of subnetworks coding category and rule on the input layer and those coding contingency on the output layer, with a subnetwork for integration in the intermediate layer. These results suggest that category-based logical thinking is realized in the PFC by separated neural populations organized for working in a feedforward manner.To elucidate the neural process for logical thinking, we combined an in-depth analysis of single-unit activity data with a biologically plausible computational model.

In light of these findings, it is not surprising that attempts to generate a holistic model of cerebellar learning across different behaviors have not been successful. While the cerebellum remains an ideal system for linking neuronal function with behavior, it is necessary to update the cerebellar circuit framework to achieve its great promise.

       "  'abstract': 'Dendritic computations have a central role in neuronal function, but it is unknown how cell-class heterogeneity of dendritic electrical excitability shapes physiologically engaged neuronal and circuit computations. To address this, we examined dendritic integration in closely related classes of retinal ganglion cells (GCs) using simultaneous somato-dendritic electrical recording techniques in a functionally intact circuit. Simultaneous recordings revealed sustained OFF-GCs generated powerful dendritic spikes in response to visual input that drove action potential firing. In contrast, the dendrites of transient OFF-GCs were passive and did not generate dendritic spikes. Dendritic spike generation allowed sustained, but not transient, OFF-GCs to signal into action potential output the local motion of visual stimuli to produce a continuous wave of action potential firing in adjacent cells as images moved across the retina. Conversely, this representation was highly fragmented in transient OFF-GCs. Thus, a heterogeneity of dendritic excitability defines the computations executed by classes of GCs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Axonal regeneration in the central nervous system is an energy-intensive process. In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish can functionally recover from neuronal injury. This raises the question of how zebrafish can cope with this high energy demand. We previously showed that in adult zebrafish, subjected to an optic nerve crush, an antagonistic axon-dendrite interplay exists wherein the retraction of retinal ganglion cell dendrites is a prerequisite for effective axonal repair. We postulate a 'dendrites for regeneration' paradigm that might be linked to intraneuronal mitochondrial reshuffling, as ganglion cells likely have insufficient resources to maintain dendrites and restore axons simultaneously. Here, we characterized both mitochondrial distribution and mitochondrial dynamics within the different ganglion cell compartments (dendrites, somas, and axons) during the regenerative process. Optic nerve crush resulted in a reduction of mitochondria in the dendrites during dendritic retraction, whereafter enlarged mitochondria appeared in the optic nerve/tract during axonal regrowth. Upon dendritic regrowth in the retina, mitochondrial density inside the retinal dendrites returned to baseline levels. Moreover, a transient increase in mitochondrial fission and biogenesis was observed in retinal ganglion cell somas after optic nerve damage. Taken together, these findings suggest that during optic nerve injury-induced regeneration, mitochondria shift from the dendrites to the axons and back again and that temporary changes in mitochondrial dynamics support axonal and dendritic regrowth after optic nerve crush.\",\n",

To accelerate the application of intersectional genetics, we perform a brain-wide characterization of 13 Flp and tTA mouse driver lines and selected seven for further analysis based on expression of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters. Using selective Cre driver lines, we created more than 10 Cre/tTA combinational lines for cell type targeting and circuit analysis.

Focusing on the lateral habenula (LHb) as a target, we identified glutamatergic, GABAergic, or co-glutamatergic/GABAergic innervations from ∼40 brain regions.

       "  'abstract': 'Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor necessary for the maturation of microglia, as well as other peripheral immune cells. It also regulates the transition of microglia and other immune cells to a pro-inflammatory phenotype.  is also a known risk gene for multiple sclerosis and lupus, and it has recently been shown to be downregulated in schizophrenia. While most studies have focused on IRF8-dependent regulation of immune cell function, little is known about how it impacts neural circuits. Here, we show by RNAseq from   male and female mouse brains that several genes involved in regulation of neural activity are dysregulated. We then show that these molecular changes are reflected in heightened neural excitability and a profound increase in susceptibility to lethal seizures in male and female   mice. Finally, we identify that TNF-α is elevated specifically in microglia in the CNS, and genetic or acute pharmacological blockade of TNF-α in the   CNS rescued the seizure phenotype. These results provide important insights into the consequences of IRF8 signaling and TNF-α on neural circuits. Our data further suggest that neuronal function is impacted by loss of IRF8, a factor involved in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we identify a previously unknown and key role for interferon regulator factor 8 (IRF8) in regulating neural excitability and seizures. We further determine that these effects on neural circuits are through elevated TNF-α in the CNS. As IRF8 has most widely been studied in the context of regulating the development and inflammatory signaling in microglia and other immune cells, we have uncovered a novel function. Further, IRF8 is a risk gene for multiple sclerosis and lupus, IRF8 is dysregulated in schizophrenia, and elevated TNF-α has been identified in a multitude of neurologic conditions. Thus, elucidating these IRF8 and TNF-α-dependent effects on brain circuit function has profound implications for understanding underlying, therapeutically relevant mechanisms of disease.',\n",

In the brain, the Slitrk2 protein was strongly detected in the hippocampus, vestibulocerebellum, and precerebellar nuclei-the vestibular-cerebellar-brainstem neural network including pontine gray and tegmental reticular nucleus. Slitrk2 knockout (KO) mice exhibited increased locomotor activity in novel environments, antidepressant-like behaviors, enhanced vestibular function, and increased plasticity at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses with reduced sensitivity to serotonin. A serotonin metabolite was increased in the hippocampus and amygdala, and serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei were decreased in Slitrk2 KO mice. When KO mice were treated with methylphenidate, lithium, or fluoxetine, the mood stabilizer lithium showed a genotype-dependent effect.

       "  'abstract': \"Pain is a multidimensional perception that includes unpleasant somatosensory and affective experiences; however, the underlying neural circuits that mediate different components of pain remain elusive. Although hyperactivity of basolateral amygdala glutamatergic (BLA) neurons is required for the somatosensory and emotional processing of pain, the precise excitatory inputs to BLA neurons and their roles in mediating different aspects of pain are unclear. Here, we identified two discrete glutamatergic neuronal circuits in male mice: a projection from the insular cortex glutamatergic (IC) to BLA neurons, which modulates both the somatosensory and affective components of pain, and a projection from the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) to BLA neurons, which modulates only the aversive-affective component of pain. Using whole-cell recording and fiber photometry, we found that neurons within the IC→BLA and MD→BLA pathways were activated in mice upon inflammatory pain induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into their paws. Optical inhibition of the IC→BLA pathway increased the nociceptive threshold and induced behavioral place preference in CFA mice. In contrast, optical inhibition of the MD→BLA pathway did not affect the nociceptive threshold but still induced place preference in CFA mice. In normal mice, optical activation of the IC→BLA pathway decreased the nociceptive threshold and induced place aversion, while optical activation of the MD→BLA pathway only evoked aversion. Taken together, our results demonstrate that discrete IC→BLA and MD→BLA pathways are involved in modulating different components of pain, provide insights into its circuit basis, and better our understanding of pain perception.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \". Ultrasound modulates the firing activity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but the effects of lower-frequency, lower-intensity ultrasound on RGCs and underlying mechanism(s) remain poorly understood. This study aims to address these questions.. Multi-electrode recordings were used in this study to record the firing sequences of RGCs in isolated mouse retinas. RGCs' background firing activities as well as their light responses were recorded with or without ultrasound stimulation. Cross-correlation analyses were performed to investigate the possible cellular/circuitry mechanism(s) underlying ultrasound modulation.. It was found that ultrasound stimulation of isolated mouse retina enhanced the background activity of ON-RGCs and OFF-RGCs. In addition, background ultrasound stimulation shortened the light response latency of both ON-RGCs and OFF-RGCs, while enhancing part of the RGCs' (both ON- and OFF-subtypes) light response and decreasing that of the others. In some ON-OFF RGCs, the ON- and OFF-responses of an individual cell were oppositely modulated by the ultrasound stimulation, which suggests that ultrasound stimulation does not necessarily exert its effect directly on RGCs, but rather via its influence on other type(s) of cells. By analyzing the cross-correlation between the firing sequences of RGC pairs, it was found that concerted activity occurred during ultrasound stimulation differed from that occurred during light stimulation, in both spatial and temporal aspects. These results suggest that the cellular circuits involved in ultrasound- and light-induced concerted activities are different and glial cells may be involved in the circuit in response to ultrasound.. These findings demonstrate that ultrasound affects neuronal background activity and light responsiveness, which are critical for visual information processing. These results may also imply a hitherto unrecognized role of glial cell activation in the bidirectional modulation effects of RGCs and may be critical for the nervous system.\",\n",

Here, we describe a micropeptide known as the Plasticity-Associated Neural Transcript Short (Pants), located in the 22q11.2 region of the human genome, the microdeletion of which conveys a high risk for schizophrenia. Our data show that Pants is upregulated in early adulthood in the mossy fiber circuit of the hippocampus, where it exerts a powerful negative effect on long-term potentiation (LTP). Further, we find that Pants is secreted from neurons, where it associates with synapses but is rapidly degraded with stimulation. Pants dynamically interacts with Rtn4/Nogo-A, a well-studied regulator of adult plasticity. Pants interaction with Nogo-A augments its influence over postsynaptic AMPA receptor clustering, thus gating plasticity at adult synapses. This work shows that neural micropeptides can act as architectural modules that increase the functional diversity of the known proteome.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The glycoprotein dystroglycan was first identified in muscle, where it functions as part of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex to connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in genes involved in the glycosylation of dystroglycan cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy termed dystroglycanopathy. In addition to its well-defined role in regulating muscle integrity, dystroglycan is essential for proper central and peripheral nervous system development. Patients with dystroglycanopathy can present with a wide range of neurological perturbations, but unraveling the complex role of Dag1 in the nervous system has proven to be a challenge. Over the past two decades, animal models of dystroglycanopathy have been an invaluable resource that has allowed researchers to elucidate dystroglycan's many roles in neural circuit development. In this review, we summarize the pathways involved in dystroglycan's glycosylation and its known interacting proteins, and discuss how it regulates neuronal migration, axon guidance, synapse formation, and its role in non-neuronal cells.\",\n",

However, it remains unclear how the neurons innervating the skin detect affective and social behaviors. The C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), a specific population of somatosensory neurons in mice, appear particularly well suited, physiologically and anatomically, to perceive affective and social touch. However, their contribution to sociability has not been resolved yet. Our observations revealed that C-LTMR functional deficiency induced social isolation and reduced tactile interactions in adulthood. Conversely, transient increase in C-LTMR excitability in adults, using chemogenetics, was rewarding, promoted touch-seeking behaviors, and had prosocial influences on group dynamics. This work provides the first empirical evidence that specific peripheral inputs alone can drive complex social behaviors. It demonstrates the existence of a specialized neuronal circuit, originating in the skin, wired to promote interactions with other individuals.',\n",

We used RNA-sequencing to reveal alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the VP that are induced by cocaine self-administration in mice. We then probed gene expression in select VP neuronal subpopulations to isolate a circuit associated with cocaine intake. Finally, we used both overexpression and CRISPR-mediated knockdown to test the role of a gene target on cocaine-mediated behaviors as well as dendritic spine density. Our results showed that a large proportion (55%) of genes associated with structural plasticity were changed 24\\u2009h following cocaine intake. Among them, the transcription factor Nr4a1 (Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1, or Nur77) showed high expression levels. We found that the VP to mediodorsal thalamus (VP → MDT) projection neurons specifically were recapitulating this increase in Nr4a1 expression. Overexpressing Nr4a1 in VP → MDT neurons enhanced drug-seeking and drug-induced reinstatement, while Nr4a1 knockdown prevented self-administration acquisition and subsequent cocaine-mediated behaviors. Moreover, we showed that Nr4a1 negatively regulated spine dynamics in this specific cell subpopulation. Together, our study identifies for the first time the transcriptional mechanisms occurring in VP in drug exposure. Our study provides further understanding on the role of Nr4a1 in cocaine-related behaviors and identifies the crucial role of the VP → MDT circuit in drug intake and relapse-like behaviors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Integrating physiology with structural insights of the same neuronal circuit provides a unique approach to understanding how the mammalian brain computes information. However, combining the techniques that provide both streams of data represents an experimental challenge. When studying glomerular column circuits in the mouse olfactory bulb, this approach involves e.g., recording the neuronal activity with  2-photon (2P) calcium imaging, retrieving the circuit structure with synchrotron X-ray computed tomography with propagation-based phase contrast (SXRT) and/or serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) and correlating these datasets. Sample preparation and dataset correlation are two key bottlenecks in this correlative workflow. Here, we first quantify the occurrence of different artefacts when staining tissue slices with heavy metals to generate X-ray or electron contrast. We report improvements in the staining procedure, ultimately achieving perfect staining in ∼67% of the 0.6\\xa0mm thick olfactory bulb slices that were previously imaged  with 2P. Secondly, we characterise the accuracy of the spatial correlation between functional and structural datasets. We demonstrate that direct, single-cell precise correlation between  2P and SXRT tissue volumes is possible and as reliable as correlating between 2P and SBEM. Altogether, these results pave the way for experiments that require retrieving physiology, circuit structure and synaptic signatures in targeted regions. These correlative function-structure studies will bring a more complete understanding of mammalian olfactory processing across spatial scales and time.',\n",

While there are many causes of obesity and potential treatments that are currently known, source data indicate that the number of patients is constantly increasing. Neural mechanisms have become the subject of research and there has been an introduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging in obesity-associated altered neural signaling. Functional magnetic resonance imaging has been established as the gold standard in the assessment of neuronal functions related to nutrition. Thanks to this, it has become possible to delineate those regions of the brain that show altered activity in obese individuals. An integrative review of the literature was conducted using the keywords \"\"functional neuroimaging\" OR \"functional magnetic resonance \"OR \"fmri\" and \"obesity\" and \"reward circuit and obesity\" in PubMed and Google Scholar databases from 2017 through May 2022. Results in English and using functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate brain response to diet and food images were identified.

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, people in the United States and other countries have been using smart drugs, called nootropic or cognitive enhancers, to improve concentration and memory learning skills. However, these drugs were originally prescribed for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and dementia, and their efficacy in healthy people has not yet been established. We focused on acetylcholine in the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory learning, and elucidate the long-term effects of smart drugs on the neural circuits. Smart drugs were administered orally in normal young mice for seven weeks. The hippocampus was sectioned and compared histologically by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry for acetylcholine, and immunoelectron microscopy. There were no significant changes in acetylcholinesterase staining. However, in HE, we found perivascular edema, and choline acetyltransferase staining showed increased staining throughout the hippocampus and new signal induction in the perivascular area in the CA3, especially in the aniracetam and α-glyceryl phosphoryl choline group. Additionally, new muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signals were observed in the CA1 due to smart drug intake, suggesting that vasodilation might cause neuronal activation by increasing the influx of nutrients and oxygen. Moreover, these results suggest a possible new mechanism of acetylcholine-mediated neural circuit activation by smart drug intake.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness, as the efficacies of current antipsychotic medications are far from satisfactory. An improved understanding of the signaling molecules involved in schizophrenia may provide novel therapeutic targets. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) catalyzes cellular membrane sphingomyelin into ceramide, which is further metabolized into sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P). ASM, ceramide, and S1P at the cell surface exert critical roles in the regulation of biophysical processes that include proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation, and are thereby considered important signaling molecules. Although research on the ASM/ceramide system is still in its infancy, structural and metabolic abnormalities have been demonstrated in schizophrenia. ASM/ceramide system dysfunction is linked to the two important models of schizophrenia, the dopamine (DA) hypothesis through affecting presynaptic DA signaling, and the vulnerability-stress-inflammation model that includes the contribution of stress on the basis of genetic predisposition. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of ASM/ceramide system dysfunction in schizophrenia gained from human and animal studies, and formulate future directions from the biological landscape for the development of new treatments. Collectively, these discoveries suggest that aberrations in the ASM/ceramide system, especially in ASM activity and levels of ceramide and S1P, may alter cerebral microdomain structure and neuronal metabolism, leading to neurotransmitter (e.g., DA) dysfunction and neuroinflammation. As such, the ASM/ceramide system may offer therapeutic targets for novel medical interventions. Normalization of the aberrant ASM/ceramide system or ceramide reduction by using approved functional inhibitors of ASM, such as fluvoxamine and rosuvastatin, may improve clinical outcomes of patients with schizophrenia. These transformative findings of the ASM/ceramide system in schizophrenia, although intriguing and exciting, may pose scientific questions and challenges that will require further studies for their resolution.',\n",

The 2.5-fold increase in interneurons in humans compared with mice was compensated by a change in axonal connection probabilities and therefore did not yield a commensurate increase in inhibitory-versus-excitatory synaptic input balance on human pyramidal cells. Rather, increased inhibition created an expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network, driven by an expansion of interneuron-targeting interneuron types and an increase in their synaptic selectivity for interneuron innervation.

       "  'abstract': 'The nervous system is under tight energy constraints and must represent information efficiently. This is particularly relevant in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) in primates where neurons encode complex motion patterns to support a variety of behaviors. A sparse decomposition model based on a dimensionality reduction principle known as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was previously shown to account for a wide range of monkey MSTd visual response properties. This model resulted in sparse, parts-based representations that could be regarded as basis flow fields, a linear superposition of which accurately reconstructed the input stimuli. This model provided evidence that the seemingly complex response properties of MSTd may be a by-product of MSTd neurons performing dimensionality reduction on their input. However, an open question is how a neural circuit could carry out this function. In the current study, we propose a spiking neural network (SNN) model of MSTd based on evolved spike-timing-dependent plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling (STDP-H) learning rules. We demonstrate that the SNN model learns compressed and efficient representations of the input patterns similar to the patterns that emerge from NMF, resulting in MSTd-like receptive fields observed in monkeys. This SNN model suggests that STDP-H observed in the nervous system may be performing a similar function as NMF with sparsity constraints, which provides a test bed for mechanistic theories of how MSTd may efficiently encode complex patterns of visual motion to support robust self-motion perception. The brain may use dimensionality reduction and sparse coding to efficiently represent stimuli under metabolic constraints. Neurons in monkey area MSTd respond to complex optic flow patterns resulting from self-motion. We developed a spiking neural network model that showed MSTd-like response properties can emerge from evolving spike-timing-dependent plasticity with STDP-H parameters of the connections between then middle temporal area and MSTd. Simulated MSTd neurons formed a sparse, reduced population code capable of encoding perceptual variables important for self-motion perception. This model demonstrates that complex neuronal responses observed in MSTd may emerge from efficient coding and suggests that neurobiological plasticity, like STDP-H, may contribute to reducing the dimensions of input stimuli and allowing spiking neurons to learn sparse representations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Dear Editor, Next to focal neurological symptoms, epileptic seizures and head aches, brain tumors can less frequently bring about cognitive changes, slowed speech, difficulty sustaining mental functioning and psychiatric symptoms of personality changes and. loss of interest in daily activities, these symptoms may be evaluated as anxiety or depression. Depression is known to be a complication of brain tumours and may sometimes be seen after the presentation of neurological symptoms linked to brain tumours, and sometimes after tumor treatment (Oğuz et al. 2005, Litofsky et al. 2004, Moise and Madhusoodanan 2006, Oreskovic M et al. 2007, Rooney A et al. 2010). The dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal and medial frontal circuits constitute the three subcortical neuronal circuits in the frontal cortex. The dorsolateral prefrontal circuit is associated with planning and operational functions and lesions on it may give rise to apathy, abulia, perseveration, personality changes and planning disorder. Lesions involving the orbitofrontal circuit, which is associated with response suppression and disinhibition, may involve emotional lability and memory problems. Whereas lesions affecting the right orbitofrontal circuit give rise to elevated mood, lesions on the left orbitofrontal circuit lead to depressed mood. In cases with medial frontal circuit involvement, akinetic mutism may result from lesions in the superior medial region and anteroretrograde amnesia and confabulation are observed with lesions in the inferior medial region (Tosun et al. 2016, Chirchiglia 2018). A diagnosis of psychiatric disorder may be given during the first examination of patieants with primary brain tumours, especially if localized in the frontal lobe. Thorough history taking and physical examination are necessary for early diagnosis. The case reported here concerns a 29-year-old university graduate female patient, living with her partner and children, who consulted the clinic with complaints of tendency to frequent crying, anhedonia, having difficulty with speech fluency, forgetfulness and distractedness that had presented suddenly, 2 months previously, without any causative stressor. In her mental status examination, she appeared having normal self-care with appearance at her actual age. She was fully conscious and oriented, not willing to cooperate with the interview, had distinct difficulty in maintaining attention and with fluency of speech. Her mood was depressive. She described loss of appetite, fatigue and energy loss. Her difficulty in paying attention was pronounced. She did not have a history of psychotropic medication use or family history of psychiatric disease. She did not smoke or use alcohol or substance. After evaluating the clinical interview, a preliminary diagnosis of major depressive disorder was considered on the basis of the DSM-5 criteria. Routine blood tests were requested. Given the continuation of her complaints, the difficulty with fluent speech and the increase in tendency to sleep at the first week follow up, cranial MRI was planned. The MRI results showed on the right, in the frontal lobe a multilocular mass with precallosal extension, undiscernable margins with the right lateral aspect of the corpus callosum genu and dispersed cystic-necrotic areas with T2 signal series. The dimensions of the mass were nearly 5 x 3 cm causing a 1-cm right-to-left shift of the midline (Figure 1) DEPRESSION AS THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF FRONTAL LOBE GRADE 2 MALIGNANT GLIOMA 2 Türk Psikiyatri Dergisi 2 Turkish Journal of Psychiatry Letter to the Editor 143 144 The patient was referred for surgery with the preliminary diagnosis of high-grade glial tumour. Pathology results identified a grade 2 glioma. It was learned that radiotherapy sessions were begun after surgery. The patient did not have any symptoms of psychopathology during the 2 monthly psychiatric interviews made after surgery. Brain tumours generally indicate their presence with headache, seizures and other neurological symptoms and very rarely with depression as seen in the case of our patient. It should be kept in mind that atypical psychiatric symptoms may have an underlying organic lesion and subtle neurological symptoms should be investigated in detail. A recent meta-analysis on 37 observational studies determined a 21.7% prevalence of depression in a total of 4518 patients with intracranial tumours. Comorbidity of depression with brain tumor was demonstrated to worsen the quality of life, increase suicidal risk and lower the chance of survival (Huang et al. 2017). The possibility of psychiatric symptoms being the clinical clues for brain cancer was noted and the necessity of neuroimaging tests in cases of recent-onset psychosis or mood disorder symptoms, atypical personality changes and anorexia without body dysmorphic disorder was emphasized (Madhusoodanan et al. 2015). Loss of interest, tendency to frequent weeping, introversion and anhedonia were the sole complaints in the case discussed here. The increase in psychomotor retardation and slowing down of movements at the very first weekly control follow up necessitated neuroimaging. Despite the reports in the literature on the frequent association of unpreventable excessive behavior, disinhibition and irritability with right frontal injury and lesions (Okumuş and Hocaoğlu 2018), depression was the dominant symptom in the case presented here. There are differences between primary major depression and depression presenting with underlying somatic diseases which is known to occur at later ages (Rouchell et al. 2002). However, our patient was aged 29 years. Also, cases of depression due to somatic disease are less associated with family history of depression and suicidal ideation and attempts, while cognitive symptoms come to the foreground during mental status examination. (Sertöz and Mete 2004, Rouchell et al. 2002). Our patient did not have suicidal ideation or attempts, or a family history of depression. In apathy, which may be explained as emotional blunting, indifference or detachment from the external world, targeted behavior is also reduced next to the lack of emotional expression. The individual discussed here was learned not to sit at the table or change the television channel unless reminded to do so. When the reason was asked, she could not think of one. The reduction in emotional expression accompanies reduced insight, abulia and lack of empathy (Sözeri Varma et al. 2019). In depression, apathy is defined as 'sorrowless depression'. Our patient cried but had very blunted mimics and gestures. She explained that she could not help weeping even at times when she did not feel internally distressed. The seriousness of apathy, as a symptom difficult to differentiate from depression, is still not understood.

Comparison of 45 individuals with depression due to aging and 43 healthy individuals showed apathy to be associated with fronto-limbic gray and white matter abnormalities which continued after antidepressant treatment. The structural anomalies of the posterior subgenual cingulate gyrus and the uncinate fasciculus were discussed (Yuen 2014). The case discussed here is presented to emphasize the importance of brain imaging methods and detailed investigation of atypical symptoms for diagnostic approaches to psychiatric disorders. Especially, complaints at young age of depression with psychomotor retardation, reduced fluency of speech and sudden onset withdrawal without stressors should be a warning of secondary depression.

The cellular and developmental processes that allow for the growth of axons and dendrites, selection of synaptic targets, and formation of functional synapses use neuronal surface receptors and their interactions with other surface receptors, secreted ligands, and matrix molecules. Spatiotemporal regulation of the expression of these receptors and cues allows for specificity in the developmental pathways that wire stereotyped circuits. The families of molecules controlling axon guidance and synapse formation are generally conserved across animals, with some important exceptions, which have consequences for neuronal connectivity.

       "  'abstract': 'Neurons in the mammalian central nervous system display an enormous capacity for circuit formation during development but not later in life. In principle, new circuits could be also formed in adult brain, but the absence of the developmental milieu and the presence of growth inhibition and hundreds of working circuits are generally viewed as unsupportive for such a process. Here, we bring together evidence from different areas of neuroscience-such as neurological disorders, adult-brain neurogenesis, innate behaviours, cell grafting, and in vivo cell reprogramming-which demonstrates robust circuit formation in adult brain. In some cases, adult-brain rewiring is ongoing and required for certain types of behaviour and memory, while other cases show significant promise for brain repair in disease models. Together, these examples highlight that the adult brain has higher capacity for structural plasticity than previously recognized. Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind this retained plasticity has the potential to advance basic knowledge regarding the molecular organization of synaptic circuits and could herald a new era of neural circuit engineering for therapeutic repair.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neural communication in the adult nervous system is mediated primarily through chemical synapses, where action potentials elicit Ca signals, which trigger vesicular fusion and neurotransmitter release in the presynaptic compartment. At early stages of development, the brain is shaped by communication via trophic factors and other extracellular signaling, and by contact-mediated cell-cell interactions including chemical synapses. The patterns of early neuronal impulses and spontaneous and regulated neurotransmitter release guide the precise topography of axonal projections and contribute to determining cell survival. The study of the role of specific proteins of the synaptic vesicle release machinery in the establishment, plasticity, and maintenance of neuronal connections during development has only recently become possible, with the advent of mouse models where various members of the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex have been genetically manipulated. We provide an overview of these models, focusing on the role of regulated vesicular release and/or cellular excitability in synaptic assembly, development and maintenance of cortical circuits, cell survival, circuit level excitation-inhibition balance, myelination, refinement, and plasticity of key axonal projections from the cerebral cortex. These models are important for understanding various developmental and psychiatric conditions, and neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Understanding circuit-level manipulations that affect the brain's capacity for plasticity will inform the design of targeted interventions that enhance recovery after stroke. Following stroke, increased contralesional activity (e.g. use of the unaffected limb) can negatively influence recovery, but it is unknown which specific neural connections exert this influence, and to what extent increased contralesional activity affects systems- and molecular-level biomarkers of recovery. Here, we combine optogenetic photostimulation with optical intrinsic signal imaging to examine how contralesional excitatory activity affects cortical remodeling after stroke in mice. Following photothrombosis of left primary somatosensory forepaw (S1FP) cortex, mice either recovered spontaneously or received chronic optogenetic excitation of right S1FP over the course of 4 weeks. Contralesional excitation suppressed perilesional S1FP remapping and was associated with abnormal patterns of stimulus-evoked activity in the unaffected limb. This maneuver also prevented the restoration of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the S1FP network, RSFC in several networks functionally distinct from somatomotor regions, and resulted in persistent limb-use asymmetry. In stimulated mice, perilesional tissue exhibited transcriptional changes in several genes relevant for recovery. Our results suggest that contralesional excitation impedes local and global circuit reconnection through suppression of cortical activity and several neuroplasticity-related genes after stroke, and highlight the importance of site selection for targeted therapeutic interventions after focal ischemia.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'How circuits self-assemble starting from neuronal stem cells is a fundamental question in developmental neurobiology. Here, we addressed how neurons from different stem cell lineages wire with each other to form a specific circuit motif. In  larvae, we combined developmental genetics (twin-spot mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker, multi-color flip out, permanent labeling) with circuit analysis (calcium imaging, connectomics, network science). For many lineages, neuronal progeny are organized into subunits called temporal cohorts. Temporal cohorts are subsets of neurons born within a tight time window that have shared circuit-level function. We find sharp transitions in patterns of input connectivity at temporal cohort boundaries. In addition, we identify a feed-forward circuit that encodes the onset of vibration stimuli. This feed-forward circuit is assembled by preferential connectivity between temporal cohorts from different lineages. Connectivity does not follow the often-cited early-to-early, late-to-late model. Instead, the circuit is formed by sequential addition of temporal cohorts from different lineages, with circuit output neurons born before circuit input neurons. Further, we generate new tools for the fly community. Our data raise the possibility that sequential addition of neurons (with outputs oldest and inputs youngest) could be one fundamental strategy for assembling feed-forward circuits.',\n",

To fully leverage the immense potential of these techniques, advanced optical instruments that can place a light on custom ensembles of neurons with a high level of spatial and temporal precision are required. Modern light sculpting techniques that have the capacity to shape a beam of light are preferred because they can precisely target multiple neurons simultaneously and modulate the activity of large ensembles of individual neurons at rates that match natural neuronal dynamics. The most versatile approach, computer-generated holography (CGH), relies on a computer-controlled light modulator placed in the path of a coherent laser beam to synthesize custom three-dimensional (3D) illumination patterns and illuminate neural ensembles on demand.

       "  'abstract': 'Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are widespread vectors in neuroscience research. However, the nearly absent retrograde access to projection neurons hampers their application in functional dissection of neural circuits and in therapeutic intervention. Recently, engineering of the AAV2 capsid has generated an AAV variant, called rAAV2-retro, with exceptional retrograde functionality. This variant comprises a 10-mer peptide insertion at residue 587 and two point mutations (LADQDYTKTA\\xa0+\\xa0V708I\\xa0+\\xa0N382D). Here, we evaluated the contribution of each mutation to retrograde transport in prefrontal cortex -striatum and amygdala-striatum pathways, respectively. Results showed that disruption of the inserted decapeptide almost completely abolishes the retrograde access to neurons projecting to striatum. Eliminating N382D has little effect on the retrograde functionality. Restoring another mutation V708I, however, even improves its performance in amygdala-striatum pathway. Parallel comparison within same animal further confirms this conflicting effect of V708I. These results demonstrate a pivotal role of decapeptide insertion in gaining the capacity of retrograde transport and highlight a neural circuit-dependent contribution of V708I. It suggests constant and custom engineering of rAAV2-retro might be required to tackle the challenge of tremendous neuronal heterogeneity.',\n",

Given there has been no new safe, clinically effective and widely accessible treatment for AD for almost 20\\xa0years, an all-new cell therapeutic approach was trialled in canine veterinary patients, and further modelled in aged rats for more detailed neurobiological analysis. A Phase 1/2A veterinary trial was conducted in N\\u2009=\\u20096 older companion dogs with definitive diagnosis of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD). Treatment comprised direct microinjection of 250,000 autologous skin-derived neuroprecursors (SKNs) into the bilateral hippocampus using MRI-guided stereotaxis. Safety was assessed clinically and efficacy using the validated Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Rating Scale (CCDR) at baseline and 3-month post treatment. Intention to treat analysis imputed a single patient that had a surgical adverse event requiring euthanasia. Three dog brains were donated following natural death and histology carried out to quantify Alzheimer pathology as well as immature neurons and synapses; these were compared to a brain bank (N\\u2009=\\u200912) of untreated aged dogs with and without CCD. Further, an age-related memory dysfunction rat model (N\\u2009=\\u200916) was used to more closely evaluate intrahippocampal engraftment of canine SKN cells, focusing on mnemonic and synaptic effects as well as donor cell survival, neurodifferentation and electrophysiologic circuit integration in a live hippocampal slice preparation. Four out-of-five dogs improved on the primary clinical CCDR endpoint, three fell below diagnostic threshold, and remarkably, two underwent full syndromal reversal lasting up to 2\\xa0years. At post mortem, synaptic density in the hippocampus specifically was nine standard deviations above non-treated dogs, and intensity of new neurons also several fold higher. There was no impact on AD pathology or long-term safety signals. Modelling in aged rats replicated the main canine trial findings: hippocampally-dependent place memory deficits were reversed and synaptic depletion rescued. In addition, this model confirmed donor cell survival and migration throughout the hippocampus, neuronal differentiation in situ, and physiologically-correct integration into pyramidal layer circuits. With further development, SKN cell therapy may have potential for treating carefully chosen AD patients based on neurosynaptic restoration in the hippocampus. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Vagus nerve stimulation has been suggested to affect immune responses, partly through a neuronal circuit requiring sympathetic innervation of the splenic nerve bundle and norepinephrine (NE) release. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of action remain elusive. Here, we investigated the therapeutic value of this neuromodulation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by applying electrical splenic nerve bundle stimulation (SpNS) in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Cuff electrodes were implanted around the splenic nerve bundle in mice, whereupon mice received SpNS or sham stimulation. Stimulation was applied 6 times daily for 12\\xa0days during DSS-induced colitis. Colonic and splenic tissues were collected for transcriptional analyses by qPCR and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). In addition, murine and human splenocytes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the absence or presence of NE. Single-cell RNA-seq data from publicly available data sets were analyzed for expression of β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs). Colitic mice undergoing SpNS displayed reduced colon weight/length ratios and showed improved Disease Activity Index scores with reduced Tumor Necrosis Factor α mRNA expression in the colon compared with sham stimulated mice. Analyses of splenocytes from SpNS mice using RNA-seq demonstrated specific immune metabolism transcriptome profile changes in myeloid cells. Splenocytes showed expression of β-ARs in myeloid and T cells. Cytokine production was reduced by NE in mouse and human LPS-stimulated splenocytes. Together, our results demonstrate that SpNS reduces clinical features of colonic inflammation in mice with DSS-induced colitis possibly by inhibiting splenic myeloid cell activation. Our data further support exploration of the clinical use of SpNS for patients with IBD. ',\n",

Marker analysis is also used as a tool to investigate organ functioning and disease progression. As these processes happen in three dimensions, the development of technologies that enable detection of gene expression in the whole organ or embryo is essential. Here, we describe an optimized protocol of whole mount multiplexed RNA  hybridization chain reaction version 3.0 (HCR v3.0) in combination with immunohistochemistry (IHC), followed by fructose-glycerol clearing and light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) imaging on  embryos. We developed a code to automate probe design which can be applied for designing HCR v3.0 type probe pairs for fluorescent  mRNA visualization. As proof of concept, neuronal () and glial () markers were used for multiplexed HCR v3.0. Neural progenitor () and precursor () markers were combined with immunostaining for phosphorylated-histone H3, a marker for mitosis. After comparing several tissue clearing methods, fructose-glycerol clearing was found optimal in preserving the fluorescent signal of HCR v3.0. The expression that was observed in whole mount octopus embryos matched with the previous expression data gathered from paraffin-embedded transverse sections. Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed additional spatial organization that had not been discovered using two-dimensional methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During neuronal differentiation, neuroprogenitor cells become polarized, change shape, extend axons, and form complex dendritic trees. While growing, axons are guided by molecular cues to their final destination, where they establish synaptic connections with other neuronal cells. Several layers of regulation are integrated to control neuronal development properly. Although control of mRNA translation plays an essential role in mammalian gene expression, how it contributes temporarily to the modulation of later stages of neuronal differentiation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how translation control affects pathways and processes essential for neuronal maturation, using H9-derived human neuro progenitor cells differentiated into neurons as a model. Through Ribosome Profiling (Riboseq) combined with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis, we found that translation control regulates the expression of critical hub genes. Fundamental synaptic vesicle secretion genes belonging to SNARE complex, Rab family members, and vesicle acidification ATPases are strongly translationally regulated in developing neurons. Translational control also participates in neuronal metabolism modulation, particularly affecting genes involved in the TCA cycle and glutamate synthesis/catabolism. Importantly, we found translation regulation of several critical genes with fundamental roles regulating actin and microtubule cytoskeleton pathways, critical to neurite generation, spine formation, axon guidance, and circuit formation. Our results show that translational control dynamically integrates important signals in neurons, regulating several aspects of its development and biology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In humans, early-life adversity (ELA) such as trauma, poverty, and chaotic environment is linked to increased risk of later-life emotional disorders including depression and substance abuse. These disorders involve underlying disruption of reward circuits and likely vary by sex. Accordingly, we previously found that ELA leads to anhedonia for natural rewards and cocaine in male rodents, whereas in females ELA instead increases vulnerability to addiction-like use of opioid drugs and palatable food. While these findings suggest that ELA-induced disruption of reward circuitry may differ between the sexes, the specific circuit nodes that are influenced by ELA in either sex remain poorly understood. Here, in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, we ask how ELA impacts opioid addiction-relevant behaviors that we previously tested after ELA in females. We probe potential circuit mechanisms in males by assessing opioid-associated neuronal activation in stress and reward circuit nodes including nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and paraventricular thalamus. We find that ELA diminishes opioid-seeking behaviors in males, and alters heroin-induced activation of NAc, PFC, and amygdala, suggesting a potential circuit-based mechanism. These studies demonstrate that ELA leads to behavioral and neurobiological disruptions consistent with anhedonia in male rodents, unlike the increased opioid seeking we previously saw in females. Our findings, taken together with our prior work, suggest that men and women could face qualitatively different mental health consequences of ELA, which may be essential for individually tailoring future intervention strategies.',\n",

The loss of long-range input does not correlate with cell loss in distant brain regions. Interneurons transplanted into the injury site receive orthotopic local and long-range input, suggesting the machinery for establishing distant connections remains intact even after a severe injury.

It plays a critical role in a broad range of behaviors such as emotion, cognition, and social behavior; within the amygdala each nucleus has a distinct role in these behavioral processes. Topological, hodological, molecular, and functional studies suggest the presence of an amygdala-like structure in the zebrafish brain. It has been suggested that the pallial amygdala homolog corresponds to the medial zone of the dorsal telencephalon (Dm) and the subpallial amygdala homolog corresponds to the nuclei in the ventral telencephalon located close to and topographically basal to Dm. However, these brain regions are broad and understanding the functional anatomy of the zebrafish amygdala requires investigating the role of specific populations of neurons in brain function and behavior. In zebrafish, the highly efficient  transposon-mediated transgenesis method together with the targeted gene expression by the Gal4-UAS system has been a powerful tool in labeling, visualizing, and manipulating the function of specific cell types in the brain. The transgenic resource combined with neuronal activity imaging, optogenetics, pharmacology, and quantitative behavioral analyses enables functional analyses of neuronal circuits. Here, we review earlier studies focused on teleost amygdala anatomy and function and discuss how the transgenic resource and tools can help unravel the functional anatomy of the zebrafish amygdala.',\n",

Preclinical research on model organisms allows for a multiscale and multiparametric analysis in vivo of the neuronal mechanisms and holds the potential for better linking the symptoms of a neurological disorder to the underlying cellular and circuit alterations, eventually leading to the identification of therapeutic/rescue strategies. In recent years, brain research in model organisms has taken advantage, along with other techniques, of the development and continuous refinement of methods that use light and optical approaches to reconstruct the activity of brain circuits at the cellular and system levels, and to probe the impact of the different neuronal components in the observed dynamics. These tools, combining low-invasiveness of optical approaches with the power of genetic engineering, are currently revolutionizing the way, the scale and the perspective of investigating brain diseases.

The concurrent loss of retrograde support interferes with the functionality and survival of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Previous research has shown that stimulation of neuronal activity in a primary retinal target area-i.e., the superior colliculus-promotes RGC survival in an acute mouse model of glaucoma. To build further on this observation, we applied repeated chemogenetics in the superior colliculus of a more chronic murine glaucoma model-i.e., the microbead occlusion model-and performed bulk RNA sequencing on collicular lysates and isolated RGCs. Our study revealed that chronic target stimulation upon glaucomatous injury phenocopies the a priori expected molecular response: growth factors were pinpointed as essential transcriptional regulators both in the locally stimulated tissue and in distant, unstimulated RGCs. Strikingly, and although the RGC transcriptome revealed a partial reversal of the glaucomatous signature and an enrichment of pro-survival signaling pathways, functional rescue of injured RGCs was not achieved. By postulating various explanations for the lack of RGC neuroprotection, we aim to warrant researchers and drug developers for the complexity of chronic neuromodulation and growth factor signaling.',\n",

Here we identify a previously uncharacterized population of neurons in the ventral medial preoptic area (VMPO) of the hypothalamus that are activated after sickness induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. These neurons are crucial for generating a fever response and other sickness symptoms such as warmth-seeking and loss of appetite. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization uncovered the identity and distribution of LPS-activated VMPO (VMPO) neurons and non-neuronal cells. Gene expression and electrophysiological measurements implicate a paracrine mechanism in which the release of immune signals by non-neuronal cells during infection activates nearby VMPO neurons. Finally, we show that VMPO neurons exert a broad influence on the activity of brain areas associated with behavioural and homeostatic functions and are synaptically and functionally connected to circuit nodes controlling body temperature and appetite. Together, these results uncover VMPO neurons as a control hub that integrates immune signals to orchestrate multiple sickness symptoms in response to infection.',\n",

While basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal responses during fear conditioning are well studied, little is known about how BLA neurons respond during naturalistic events. We recorded from the rat BLA during interaction with ethological stimuli: male or female rats, a moving toy, and rice. Forty-two percent of the cells reliably respond to at least one stimulus, with over half of these exclusively identifying one of the four stimulus classes. In addition to activation during interaction with their preferred stimulus, these cells signal micro-behavioral interactions like social contact. After stimulus removal, firing activity persists in 30% of responsive cells for several minutes. At the micro-circuit level, information flows from highly tuned event-specific neurons to less specific neurons, and connection strength increases after the event. We propose that individual BLA neurons identify specific ethological events, with event-specific neurons driving circuit-wide activity during and after salient events.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Functional maps of the central nervous system attribute the coordination and control of many body movements directly or indirectly to the cerebellum. Despite this general picture, there is little information on the function of cerebellar neural components at the circuit level. The presence of multiple synaptic junctions and the synergistic action of different types of plasticity make it virtually difficult to determine the distinct contribution of cerebellar neural processes to behavioral manifestations. In this study, investigating the effect of long-term synaptic changes on cerebellar motor learning, we intend to provide quantitative criteria for localizing defects in the major forms of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum.To this end, we develop a firing rate model of the cerebellar circuits to simulate learning of optokinetic reflex (OKR), one of the most well-known cerebellar-dependent motor tasks. In the following, by comparing the simulated OKR learning profile for normal and pathosynaptic conditions, we extract the learning features affected by long-term plasticity disorders. Next, conducting simulation with different massed (continuous with no rest) and spaced (interleaved with rest periods) learning paradigms, we estimate the detrimental impact of plasticity defects at corticonuclear synapses on short- and long-term motor memory.Our computational approach predicts a correlation between location and grade of the defect with some learning factors such as the rate of formation and retention of motor memory, baseline performance, and even cerebellar motor reserve capacity. Further, spacing analysis reveal the dependence of learning paradigm efficiency on the spatiotemporal characteristic of defect in the network. Indeed, defects in cortical memory formation and nuclear memory consolidation mainly harm massed and spaced learning, respectively. This result is used to design a differential assay for identifying the faulty phases of cerebellar learning.The proposed computational framework can help develop neural-screening systems and prepare meso-scale functional maps of the cerebellar circuits.',\n",

Chill coma is mediated by a spreading depolarization of neurons and glia in the CNS, triggered by a failure of ion homeostasis. We used biochemical and electrophysiological approaches in the locust, Locusta migratoria, to test the hypothesis that the protection afforded by RCH is mediated by activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) in neural tissue. RCH did not affect NKA activity measured in a biochemical assay of homogenized thoracic ganglia. However, RCH hyperpolarized the axon of a visual interneuron (DCMD) and increased the amplitude of an activity-dependent hyperpolarization (ADH) shown previously to be blocked by ouabain. RCH also improved performance of the visual circuitry presynaptic to DCMD to minimize habituation and increase excitability.

However, GABAergic currents sometimes exhibit non-inhibitory effects, depending on the brain region, developmental stage or pathological condition. Here, we investigate the diverse effects of GABA on the firing rate of several single neuron models, using both analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We find that GABAergic synaptic conductance and output firing rate exhibit three qualitatively different regimes as a function of GABA reversal potential, EGABA: monotonically decreasing for sufficiently low EGABA (inhibitory), monotonically increasing for EGABA above firing threshold (excitatory); and a non-monotonic region for intermediate values of EGABA. In the non-monotonic regime, small GABA conductances have an excitatory effect while large GABA conductances show an inhibitory effect. We provide a phase diagram of different GABAergic effects as a function of GABA reversal potential and glutamate conductance. We find that noisy inputs increase the range of EGABA for which the non-monotonic effect can be observed. We also construct a micro-circuit model of striatum to explain observed effects of GABAergic fast spiking interneurons on spiny projection neurons, including non-monotonicity, as well as the heterogeneity of the effects. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation of paradoxical effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs, with implications for understanding the effects of GABA in neural computation and development.',\n",

Conversely, sensory experience-dependent activity implements well-characterized transcriptional and epigenetic chromatin programs that underlie heterogeneous but specific genomic responses that shape both postnatal circuit development and neuroplasticity in the adult.

We show that intestinal GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying and eating via intestinofugal neurons, a subclass of myenteric neurons that project to abdominal sympathetic ganglia. Remarkably, cell-specific ablation of intestinofugal neurons eliminated intestinal GLP-1 effects, and their chemical activation functioned as a GLP-1 mimetic. GLP-1 sensing by intestinofugal neurons then engaged a sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic pathway that links abnormal stomach distension to craniofacial programs for food rejection.

Although most research has focused on modulation of principal neurons, recent progress has uncovered important roles for interneurons in not only routing information, but also setting conditions for synaptic plasticity.

It has been known for decades that LND is associated with dysfunction of midbrain dopamine neurons, without overt structural brain abnormalities. Emerging post mortem and in vitro evidence supports the hypothesis that the dopaminergic dysfunction in LND is of developmental origin, but specific pathogenic mechanisms have not been revealed. In the current study, HGprt deficiency causes specific neurodevelopmental abnormalities in mice during embryogenesis, particularly affecting proliferation and migration of developing midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons. In mutant embryos at E14.5, proliferation was increased, accompanied by a decrease in cell cycle exit and the distribution and orientation of dividing cells suggested a premature deviation from their migratory route. An abnormally structured radial glia-like scaffold supporting this mDA neuronal migration might lie at the basis of these abnormalities. Consequently, these abnormalities were associated with an increase in area occupied by TH cells and an abnormal mDA subpopulation organization at E18.5. Finally, dopaminergic innervation was disorganized in prefrontal and decreased in HGprt deficient primary motor and somatosensory cortices. These data provide direct in vivo evidence for a neurodevelopmental nature of the brain disorder in LND. Future studies should not only focus the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the reported neurodevelopmental abnormalities, but also on optimal timing of therapeutic interventions to rescue the DA neuron defects, which may also be relevant for other neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",

This relationship is puzzling because overall changes in correlated variability should minimally affect optimal information coding. We hypothesize that this relationship arises because instead of using optimal strategies for decoding the specific stimuli at hand, observers prioritize : a single set of neuronal weights to decode any stimuli. We tested this using a combination of multineuron recordings in the visual cortex of behaving rhesus monkeys and a cortical circuit model. We found that general decoders optimized for broad rather than narrow sets of visual stimuli better matched the animals' decoding strategy, and that their performance was more related to the magnitude of correlated variability. In conclusion, the inverse relationship between perceptual performance and correlated variability can be explained by observers using a general decoding strategy, capable of decoding neuronal responses to the variety of stimuli encountered in natural vision.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The development of the central nervous system (CNS) in flies and mammals requires the production of distinct neurons in different locations and times. Here we review progress on how Drosophila stem cells (neuroblasts; NBs) generate distinct neurons over time. There are two types of NBs: type I and type II NBs (defined below); here we focus on type I NBs; type II NBs are reviewed elsewhere in this issue. Type I NBs generate neural diversity via the cascading expression of specific temporal transcription factors (TTFs). TTFs are sequentially expressed in neuroblasts and required for the identity of neurons born during each TTF expression window. In this way TTFs specify the \"temporal identity\" or birth-order dependent identity of neurons. Recent studies have shown that TTF expression in neuroblasts alter the identity of their progeny, including directing motor neurons to form proper connectivity to the proper muscle targets, independent of their birth-order. Similarly, optic lobe (OL) type I NBs express a series of TTFs that promote proper neuron morphology and targeting to the four OL neuropils. Together, these studies demonstrate how temporal identity is crucial in promoting proper circuit assembly within the Drosophila CNS. In addition, TTF orthologs in mouse are good candidates for specifying neuron types in the neocortex and retina. In this review we highlight the recent advances in understanding the role of TTFs in CNS circuit assembly in Drosophila and reflect on the conservation of these mechanisms in mammalian CNS development.',\n",

We prepared a purified pheromonal fraction and Vmn2r53 knockout mice and applied genetic tools for neuronal activity recording, manipulation, and circuit tracing to decipher the neural mechanisms underlying Vmn2r53-mediated aggression. We found that Vmn2r53-mediated aggression is regulated by specific neuronal populations in the ventral premammillary nucleus and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus.

       "  'abstract': 'The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems regulate the activities of internal organs, but the molecular and functional diversity of their constituent neurons and circuits remains largely unknown. Here we use retrograde neuronal tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, optogenetics and physiological experiments to dissect the cardiac parasympathetic control circuit in mice. We show that cardiac-innervating neurons in the brainstem nucleus ambiguus (Amb) are comprised of two molecularly, anatomically and functionally distinct subtypes. The first, which we call ambiguus cardiovascular (ACV) neurons (approximately 35 neurons per Amb), define the classical cardiac parasympathetic circuit. They selectively innervate a subset of cardiac parasympathetic ganglion neurons and mediate the baroreceptor reflex, slowing heart rate and atrioventricular node conduction in response to increased blood pressure. The other, ambiguus cardiopulmonary (ACP) neurons (approximately 15 neurons per Amb) innervate cardiac ganglion neurons intermingled with and functionally indistinguishable from those innervated by ACV neurons. ACP neurons also innervate most or all lung parasympathetic ganglion neurons-clonal labelling shows that individual ACP neurons innervate both organs. ACP neurons mediate the dive reflex, the simultaneous bradycardia and bronchoconstriction that follows water immersion. Thus, parasympathetic control of the heart is organized into two parallel circuits, one that selectively controls cardiac function (ACV circuit) and another that coordinates cardiac and pulmonary function (ACP circuit). This new understanding of cardiac control has implications for treating cardiac and pulmonary diseases and for elucidating the control and coordination circuits of other organs.',\n",

Many studies explore population models with a parametric structure for response tuning and variability, preventing an analysis of how synaptic circuitry establishes neural codes. We study stimulus coding in networks of spiking neuron models with spatially ordered excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. The wiring structure is capable of producing rich population-wide shared neuronal variability that agrees with many features of recorded cortical activity. While both the spatial scales of feedforward and recurrent projections strongly affect noise correlations, only recurrent projections, and in particular inhibitory projections, can introduce correlations that limit the stimulus information available to a decoder. Using a spatial neural field model, we relate the recurrent circuit conditions for information limiting noise correlations to how recurrent excitation and inhibition can form spatiotemporal patterns of population-wide activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Developmental neuronal remodeling is required for shaping the precise connectivity of the mature nervous system. Remodeling involves pruning of exuberant neural connections, often followed by regrowth of adult-specific ones, as a strategy to refine neural circuits. Errors in remodeling are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Despite its fundamental nature, our understanding of the mechanisms governing neuronal remodeling is far from complete. Specifically, how precise spatiotemporal control of remodeling and rewiring is achieved is largely unknown. In recent years, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and other cell surface and secreted proteins of various families, have been implicated in processes of neurite pruning and wiring specificity during circuit reassembly. Here, we review some of the known as well as speculated roles of CAMs in these processes, highlighting recent advances in uncovering spatiotemporal aspects of regulation. Our focus is on the fruit fly , which is emerging as a powerful model in the field, due to the extensive, well-characterized and stereotypic remodeling events occurring throughout its nervous system during metamorphosis, combined with the wide and constantly growing toolkit to identify CAM binding and resulting cellular interactions . We believe that its many advantages pose  as a leading candidate for future breakthroughs in the field of neuronal remodeling in general, and spatiotemporal control by CAMs specifically.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Birds and mammals have independently evolved complex behavioral and cognitive capabilities yet have markedly different brain structures. An open question is to what extent, despite these differences in anatomy, birds and mammals have evolved similar neural solutions to complex motor control and at what level of organization these similarities might lie. Courtship song in songbirds, a learned motor skill that is similar to the fine motor skills of many mammals including human speech, provides a powerful system in which to study the links connecting the development and evolution of cells, circuits, and behavior. Until recently, obtaining cellular-resolution views of the specialized neural circuitry that subserves birdsong was impossible due to a lack of molecular tools for songbirds. However, the ongoing revolution in cellular profiling and genomics offers unprecedented opportunities for molecular analysis in organisms that lack a traditional genetic infrastructure but have tractable, well-defined behaviors. Here, I describe recent efforts to understand the evolutionary relationships between birdsong control circuitry and mammalian neocortical circuitry using new approaches to measure gene expression in single cells. These results, combined with foundational work relating avian and mammalian brains at a range of biological levels, present an emerging view that amniote pallium evolution is a story of diverse neural circuit architectures employing conserved neuronal elements within a conserved topological framework. This view suggests that one locus of pallial neural circuit evolution lies at the intersection between the gene regulatory programs that regulate regional patterning and those that specify functional identity. Modifications to this intersection may underlie the evolution of pallial motor control in birds in general and to the evolutionary and developmental relationships of these circuits to the avian pallial amygdala.',\n",

Furthermore, transcriptomics profiling analysis revealed various cerebellar neuronal identities, and we validated that biorientation defective 1 (BOD1) played an important role in the circuit of IV/V lobe to FN. BOD1 deficit in PCs of IV/V lobe attenuated the excitability and spine density of PCs, accompany with ataxia behaviors.

We start by summarizing the literature on the prefrontal cortex and other relevant brain regions to expand the current \"prefrontal-centric\" view of social hierarchy behaviors. Based on connectivity data we also discuss candidate regions that might inspire further investigation, as well as the caveats and strategies that have been used to further our understanding of the biological substrates underpinning social hierarchy and dominance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Newborn infants are prone to sepsis and related inflammation of different organs. Neuroinflammation has been associated with long-term adverse neuronal (neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative) outcomes, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or even Alzheimer's disease. Despite a vast number of findings on sepsis-induced inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS), how neuroinflammation affects brain development remains largely elusive. In this study, neonates with clinical sepsis and screened for meningitis were included and classified by the neuroinflammation status based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters (INF vs. NOINF). CSF samples collected from clinical screening were subjected to proteomics analysis. Proteins with differential abundance were subjected to enrichment analysis to reveal affected biological pathways. INF and NOINF infants had similar demographic data and hematological and biochemical parameters in blood and CSF. The CSF proteomes were essentially different between the two groups. All 65 proteins with differential abundance showed lower abundance in the INF group and functionally covered pivotal developmental processes, including axonal and synaptic function and extracellular homeostasis. CSF proteins, PTPRZ1 and IGFBP4, were correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and ratios of immature/total neutrophils in blood. In general, a substantial change in the CSF protein profile was found under neuroinflammation, and these changes are related to systemic conditions. The results suggest that changes in CSF proteins may be involved in sepsis-affected neurodevelopment, such as disturbances in circuit formation, which has the potential to predispose neonates to long-term adverse outcomes.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Visualizing neuronal activation and neurotransmitter release by using fluorescent sensors is increasingly popular. The main drawback of contemporary multi-color or multi-region fiber photometry systems is the tethered structure that prevents the free movement of the animals. Although wireless photometry devices exist, a review of literature has shown that these devices can only optically stimulate or excite with a single wavelength simultaneously, and the lifetime of the battery is short. To tackle this limitation, we present a prototype for implementing a fully wireless photometry system with multi-color and multi-region functions. This paper introduces an integrated circuit (IC) prototype fabricated in TSMC 180 nm CMOS process technology. The prototype includes 3-channel optical excitation, 2-channel optical recording, wireless power transfer, and wireless data telemetry blocks. The recording front end has an average gain of 107 dB and consumes 620 μW of power. The light-emitting diode (LED) driver block provides a peak current of 20 mA for optical excitation. The rectifier, the core of the wireless power transmission, operates with 63% power conversion efficiency at 13.56 MHz and a maximum of 87% at 2 MHz. The system is validated in a laboratory bench test environment and compared with state-of-the-art technologies. The optical excitation and recording front end and the wireless power transfer circuit evaluated in this paper will form the basis for a future miniaturized final device with a shank that can be used in in vivo experiments.',\n",

Here, by combining exome sequencing with in silico analyses, we identified a patient affected by severe ID and cognitive regression, carrying a novel loss-of-function variant in the semaphorin 3E () gene, which encodes for a key secreted cue that controls mouse brain development. By performing ad hoc in vitro and ex vivo experiments, we found that the identified variant impairs protein secretion and hampers the binding to both embryonic mouse neuronal cells and tissues. Further, we revealed SEMA3E expression during human brain development. Overall, our findings demonstrate the pathogenic impact of the identified  variant and provide evidence that clinical neurological features of the patient might be due to a defective SEMA3E signaling in the brain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Glucocorticoid-dependent mechanisms of inflammation-mediated distant hippocampal damage are discussed with a focus on the consequences of traumatic brain injury. The effects of glucocorticoids on specific neuronal populations in the hippocampus depend on their concentration, duration of exposure and cell type. Previous stress and elevated level of glucocorticoids prior to pro-inflammatory impact, as well as long-term though moderate elevation of glucocorticoids, may inflate pro-inflammatory effects. Glucocorticoid-mediated long-lasting neuronal circuit changes in the hippocampus after brain trauma are involved in late post-traumatic pathology development, such as epilepsy, depression and cognitive impairment. Complex and diverse actions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on neuroinflammation may be essential for late post-traumatic pathology. These mechanisms are applicable to remote hippocampal damage occurring after other types of focal brain damage (stroke, epilepsy) or central nervous system diseases without obvious focal injury. Thus, the liaisons of excessive glucocorticoids/dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with neuroinflammation, dangerous to the hippocampus, may be crucial to distant hippocampal damage in many brain diseases. Taking into account that the hippocampus controls both the cognitive functions and the emotional state, further research on potential links between glucocorticoid signaling and inflammatory processes in the brain and respective mechanisms is vital.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuronal responses to peptide signaling are determined by the specific binding of a peptide to its receptor(s). For example, isoforms of the same peptide family can drive distinct responses in the same circuit by having different affinities for the same receptor, by having each isoform bind to a different receptor, or by a combination of these scenarios. Small changes in peptide composition can alter the binding kinetics and overall physiological response to a given peptide. In the American lobster (Homarus americanus), native isoforms of C-type allatostatins (AST-Cs) usually decrease heartbeat frequency and alter contraction force. However, one of the three AST-C isoforms, AST-C II, drives a cardiac response distinct from the response elicited by the other two. To investigate the aspects of the peptide that might be responsible for these differential responses, we altered various features of each peptide sequence. Although the presence of an amide group at the end of a peptide sequence (amidation) is often essential for determining physiological function, we demonstrate that C-terminal amidation does not dictate the AST-C response in the lobster cardiac system. However, single amino acid substitution within the consensus sequence did account for many of the differences in specific response characteristics (e.g. contraction frequency or force).',\n",

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we revealed a subcluster of GABAergic neurons characterized by cell division cycle 20 (Cdc20) mRNA expression in the NAc of adult rats. We studied the coexpression of Cdc20 and Gad1 mRNA in the NAc neurons of adult rats and assessed Cdc20 protein expression in the NAc during rat development. Moreover, we microinjected AAV2/9-hSyn-Cdc20 with or without the dual-AAV system into the bilateral NAc for sparse labeling to observe changes in the synaptic morphology of mature neurons and assessed rat behaviors in open field and elevated plus maze tests. Furthermore, we performed the experiments with a Cdc20 inhibitor, Cdc20 over-expression AAV vector, and Cdc20 conditional knockout primary striatal neurons to understand the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in vitro and in vivo. We confirmed the mRNA expression of Cdc20 in the NAc GABAergic neurons of adult rats, and its protein level was decreased significantly 3\\u2009weeks post-birth. Up-regulated Cdc20 expression in the bilateral NAc decreased the dendritic spine density in mature neurons and induced anxiety-like behavior in rats. Cdc20-APC triggered FMRP degradation through K48-linked polyubiquitination in Neuro-2a cells and primary striatal neurons and down-regulated FMRP expression in the NAc of adult rats. These data revealed that up-regulation of Cdc20 in the bilateral NAc reduced dendritic spine density and led to anxiety-like behaviors, possibly by enhancing FMRP degradation via K48-linked polyubiquitination.',\n",

These relationships remain poorly understood in patients with AD. Using empirical spectra from magnetoencephalography and computational modeling (neural mass model), we examined excitatory and inhibitory parameters of neuronal subpopulations and investigated their specific associations to regional tau and Aβ, measured by positron emission tomography, in patients with AD. Patients with AD showed abnormal excitatory and inhibitory time-constants and neural gains compared to age-matched controls. Increased excitatory time-constants distinctly correlated with higher tau depositions while increased inhibitory time-constants distinctly correlated with higher Aβ depositions. Our results provide critical insights about potential mechanistic links between abnormal neural oscillations and cellular correlates of impaired excitatory and inhibitory synaptic functions associated with tau and Aβ in patients with AD.

We thus propose recontextualizing epileptogenesis as a process where reduction in cellular heterogeneity, in part, renders neural circuits less resilient to seizure. By comparing patch clamp recordings from human layer 5 (L5) cortical pyramidal neurons from epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic tissue, we demonstrate significantly decreased biophysical heterogeneity in seizure-generating areas. Implemented computationally, this renders model neural circuits prone to sudden transitions into synchronous states with increased firing activity, paralleling ictogenesis. This computational work also explains the surprising finding of significantly decreased excitability in the population-activation functions of neurons from epileptogenic tissue. Finally, mathematical analyses reveal a bifurcation structure arising only with low heterogeneity and associated with seizure-like dynamics.

While these risks are well-established prior to sexual maturity (i.e., critical periods), the degree of neural vulnerability during adolescence remains uncertain. Here, we induce transient hearing loss (HL) spanning adolescence in gerbils, and ask whether behavioral and neural maturation are disrupted. We find that adolescent HL causes a significant perceptual deficit that can be attributed to degraded auditory cortex processing, as assessed with wireless single neuron recordings and within-session population-level analyses. Finally, auditory cortex brain slices from adolescent HL animals reveal synaptic deficits that are distinct from those typically observed after critical period deprivation.

However, the lack of comprehensive input-output wiring diagrams of Oxt neurons and their quantitative relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression presents challenges to understanding circuit-specific Oxt functions. Here, we establish a whole-brain distribution and anatomic connectivity map of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxtr expression using high-resolution 3D mapping methods in adult male and female mice. We use a flatmap to describe Oxt neuronal expression in four hypothalamic domains including under-characterized Oxt neurons in the tuberal nucleus (TU). Oxt neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) broadly project to nine functional circuits that control cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. In contrast, Oxt neurons in the supraoptic (SO) and accessory (AN) nuclei have limited central projection to a small subset of the nine circuits. Surprisingly, quantitative comparison between Oxt output and Oxtr expression showed no significant correlation across the whole brain, suggesting abundant indirect Oxt signaling in Oxtr-expressing areas. Unlike output, Oxt neurons in both the PVH and SO receive similar monosynaptic inputs from a subset of the nine circuits mainly in the thalamic, hypothalamic, and cerebral nuclei areas. Our results suggest that PVH-Oxt neurons serve as a central modulator to integrate external and internal information via largely reciprocal connection with the nine circuits while the SO-Oxt neurons act mainly as unidirectional Oxt hormonal output. In summary, our Oxt wiring diagram provides anatomic insights about distinct behavioral functions of Oxt signaling in the brain. Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons regulate diverse physiological functions from prosocial behavior to pain sensation via central projection in the brain. Thus, understanding detailed anatomic connectivity of Oxt neurons can provide insight on circuit-specific roles of Oxt signaling in regulating different physiological functions. Here, we use high-resolution mapping methods to describe the 3D distribution, monosynaptic input and long-range output of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression across the entire mouse brain. We found Oxt connections with nine functional circuits controlling cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. Furthermore, we identified a quantitatively unmatched Oxt-Oxtr relationship, suggesting broad indirect Oxt signaling. Together, our comprehensive Oxt wiring diagram advances our understanding of circuit-specific roles of Oxt neurons.',\n",

Here, we present a first-of-its-kind mathematical model to better understand the relationships among these processes. Our model describes the interaction between neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal loss, circuit remodeling, and seizures. Formulated as a system of nonlinear differential equations, the model reproduces the available data from three animal models. The model successfully describes characteristic features of epileptogenesis such as its paradoxically long timescales (up to decades) despite short and transient injuries or the existence of qualitatively different outcomes for varying injury intensity. In line with the concept of degeneracy, our simulations reveal multiple routes toward epilepsy with neuronal loss as a sufficient but non-necessary component. Finally, we show that our model allows for  predictions of therapeutic strategies, revealing injury-specific therapeutic targets and optimal time windows for intervention.',\n",

However, complex appearance changes of neuronal morphology in adjacent sections bring difficulty in finding correct correspondences, making serial section neural image registration challenging. To solve this problem, we consider whether there are such stable \"markers\" in the neural images to alleviate registration difficulty. In this paper, we employ the spherical deformation model to simulate the local neuron structure and analyze the relationship between registration accuracy and neuronal structure shapes in two adjacent sections. The relevant analysis proves that regular circular structures in the section images are instrumental in seeking robust corresponding relationships. Then, we design a new serial section image registration framework driven by this neuronal morphological model, fully utilizing the characteristics of the anatomical structure of nerve tissue and obtaining more reasonable corresponding relationships. Specifically, we leverage a deep membrane segmentation network and neural morphological physical selection model to select the stable rounded regions in neural images. Then, we combine feature extraction and global optimization of correspondence position to obtain the deformation field of multiple images. Experiments on real and synthetic serial EM section neural image datasets have demonstrated that our proposed method could achieve more reasonable and reliable registration results, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches in qualitative and quantitative analysis.',\n",

Using both short-term and long-term neuronal labeling techniques we observed expression of the cholinergic neuron marker Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT) in vGAT neurons.

Dissecting the complex interplay of cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic factors at the heart of these interactions reveals the critical basic mechanisms of neural development and how it goes awry in pediatric neurologic disorders. A full accounting of how developing neurons navigate their niches to mature and integrate into a developing neural circuit requires a combination of genetic characterization of and physical access to neurons and their supporting cell types plus transformative imaging to determine the cell biological and gene-regulatory responses to niche cues. The mouse cerebellar cortex is a prototypical experimental system meeting all of these criteria. The lessons learned therein have been scaled to other model systems and brain regions to stimulate discoveries of how developing neurons make many developmental decisions. This review focuses on how mouse cerebellar granule neuron progenitors interact with signals in their germinal niche and how that affects the neuronal differentiation and cell polarization programs that underpin lamination of the developing cerebellum. We show how modeling of these mechanisms in other systems has added to the growing evidence of how defective neuronal polarity contributes to developmental disease.',\n",

Nearly 80% of MS patients experience lower urinary tract dysfunction early in their diagnosis. This significantly affects the quality of life, and in latter stages of disease is a leading cause of hospitalization. Previously, animal models have shown that inflammatory demyelination in the CNS causes profound bladder dysfunction, but the confounding influence of systemic inflammation limits the potential interpretation of the contribution of CNS demyelination to bladder dysfunction. Since the micturition circuit has myelinated neuronal connections in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, we examined alterations in bladder function in the cuprizone model characterized by demyelinating lesions in the cortex and corpus callosum that are independent of T-cell-mediated autoimmunity. Herein, we report that a 4-week dietary cuprizone treatment in C57Bl/6J mice induced alterations in voiding behavior with increased micturition frequency and reduced volume voided, similar to human MS bladder dysfunction. Subsequently, recovery from cuprizone treatment restored normal bladder function. Demyelination and remyelination were confirmed by Luxol Fast Blue staining of the corpus callosum. Additionally, we also determined that an 8-week cuprizone treatment, resulting in chronic demyelination lacking spontaneous remyelination potential, is associated with an exacerbated voiding phenotype. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged, as confirmed by urethane-anesthetized cystometry. This is the first study to show that cortical demyelination independent of inflammation can negatively impact urinary function.',\n",

VIP has been considered as a critical factor for the circadian rhythmicity and synchronization of individual SCN neurons. However, the precise mechanisms of how VIP neurons regulate SCN circuits remain incompletely understood. Here, we generated   knock-in mice that express tetracycline transactivator (tTA) specifically in VIP neurons by inserting tTA sequence at the start codon of  gene. The specific and efficient expression of tTA in VIP neurons was verified using EGFP reporter mice. In addition, combined with  mice,   mice enabled us to simultaneously apply different genetic manipulations to VIP and AVP neurons in the SCN. Immunostaining showed that VIP is expressed at a slightly reduced level in heterozygous   mice but is completely absent in homozygous mice. Consistently, homozygous   mice showed impaired circadian behavioral rhythms similar to those of  knockout mice, such as attenuated rhythmicity and shortened circadian period. In contrast, heterozygous mice demonstrated normal circadian behavioral rhythms comparable to wild-type mice.

Phencyclidine (PCP), a drug of abuse, has psychomimetic effects, and neonatal subchronic administration of PCP in rodents leads to long-term behavioral changes relevant for schizophrenia. The cerebellum is increasingly recognized for its role in diverse cognitive functions. However, little is known about potential cerebellar changes in models of schizophrenia. Here, we analyzed the characteristics of the cerebellum in the neonatal subchronic PCP model. We found that, while the global cerebellar cytoarchitecture and Purkinje cell spontaneous spiking properties are unchanged, climbing fiber/Purkinje cell synaptic connectivity is increased in juvenile mice. Neonatal subchronic administration of PCP is accompanied by increased cFos expression, a marker of neuronal activity, and transient modification of the neuronal surfaceome in the cerebellum. The largest change observed is the overexpression of Ctgf, a gene previously suggested as a biomarker for schizophrenia. This neonatal increase in Ctgf can be reproduced by increasing neuronal activity in the cerebellum during the second postnatal week using chemogenetics. However, it does not lead to increased climbing fiber/Purkinje cell connectivity in juvenile mice, showing the complexity of PCP action. Overall, our study shows that administration of the drug of abuse PCP during the developmental period of intense cerebellar synaptogenesis and circuit remodeling has long-term and specific effects on Purkinje cell connectivity and warrants the search for this type of synaptic changes in psychiatric diseases.',\n",

While the DNs and the DNs encompass only two neurons, the DNs consist of ∼15 neurons, and the DNs comprise ∼40 neurons per brain hemisphere. In comparison to the well-characterized lateral clock neurons (LNs), the neuroanatomy and function of the DNs are still not clear. Over the past decade, numerous studies have addressed their role in the fly's circadian system, leading to several sometimes divergent results. Nonetheless, these studies agreed that the DNs are important to fine-tune activity under light and temperature cycles and play essential roles in linking the output from the LNs to downstream neurons that control sleep and metabolism. Here, we used the Flybow system, specific split-GAL4 lines, -Tango, and the recently published fly connectome (called hemibrain) to describe the morphology of the DNs in greater detail, including their synaptic connections to other clock and non-clock neurons. We show that some DN groups are largely heterogenous. While certain DNs are strongly connected with the LNs, others are mainly output neurons that signal to circuits downstream of the clock. Among the latter are mushroom body neurons, central complex neurons, tubercle bulb neurons, neurosecretory cells in the pars intercerebralis, and other still unidentified partners. This heterogeneity of the DNs may explain some of the conflicting results previously found about their functionality. Most importantly, we identify two putative novel communication centers of the clock network: one fiber bundle in the superior lateral protocerebrum running toward the anterior optic tubercle and one fiber hub in the posterior lateral protocerebrum. Both are invaded by several DNs and LNs and might play an instrumental role in the clock network.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precise wiring of neural circuits is essential for brain connectivity and function. During development, axons respond to diverse cues present in the extracellular matrix or at the surface of other cells to navigate to specific targets, where they establish precise connections with post-synaptic partners. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) represent a large group of structurally diverse proteins well known to mediate adhesion for neural circuit assembly. Through their adhesive properties, CAMs act as major regulators of axon navigation, fasciculation, and synapse formation. While the adhesive functions of CAMs have been known for decades, more recent studies have unraveled essential, non-adhesive functions as well. CAMs notably act as guidance cues and modulate guidance signaling pathways for axon pathfinding, initiate contact-mediated repulsion for spatial organization of axonal arbors, and refine neuronal projections during circuit maturation. In this review, we summarize the classical adhesive functions of CAMs in axonal development and further discuss the increasing number of other non-adhesive functions CAMs play in neural circuit assembly.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For efficient processing, spatiotemporal spike patterns representing similar input must be able to transform into a less similar output. A new computational model with physiologically plausible parameters shows how the neuronal process referred to as \"pattern separation\" can be very well achieved by single neurons if the temporal qualities of the output patterns are considered. Spike patterns generated by a varying number of neurons firing with fixed different frequencies within a gamma range are used as input. The temporal and spatial summation of dendritic input combined with theta-oscillating excitability in the output neuron by subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (SMOs) lead to high temporal separation by different delays of output spikes of similar input patterns. A Winner Takes All (WTA) mechanism with backward inhibition suffices to transform the spatial overlap of input patterns to much less temporal overlap of the output patterns. The conversion of spatial patterns input into an output with differently delayed spikes enables high separation effects. Incomplete random connectivity spreads the times up to the first spike across a spatially expanded ensemble of output neurons. With the expansion, random connectivity becomes the spatial distribution mechanism of temporal features. Additionally, a \"synfire chain\" circuit is proposed to reconvert temporal differences into spatial ones.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Dopaminergic medication for Parkinson's disease (PD) modulates neuronal oscillations and functional connectivity (FC) across the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical circuit. However, the non-oscillatory component of the neuronal activity, potentially indicating a state of excitation/inhibition balance, has not yet been investigated and previous studies have shown inconsistent changes of cortico-cortical connectivity as a response to dopaminergic medication. To further elucidate changes of regional non-oscillatory component of the neuronal power spectra, FC, and to determine which aspects of network organization obtained with graph theory respond to dopaminergic medication, we analyzed a resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) dataset including 15 PD patients during OFF and ON medication conditions. We found that the spectral slope, typically used to quantify the broadband non-oscillatory component of power spectra, steepened particularly in the left central region in the ON compared to OFF condition. In addition, using lagged coherence as a FC measure, we found that the FC in the beta frequency range between centro-parietal and frontal regions was enhanced in the ON compared to the OFF condition. After applying graph theory analysis, we observed that at the lower level of topology the node degree was increased, particularly in the centro-parietal area. Yet, results showed no significant difference in global topological organization between the two conditions: either in global efficiency or clustering coefficient for measuring global and local integration, respectively. Interestingly, we found a close association between local/global spectral slope and functional network global efficiency in the OFF condition, suggesting a crucial role of local non-oscillatory dynamics in forming the functional global integration which characterizes PD. These results provide further evidence and a more complete picture for the engagement of multiple cortical regions at various levels in response to dopaminergic medication in PD.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Temporal lobe epilepsy, a chronic disease of the brain characterized by degeneration of the hippocampus, has impaired risk assessment. Risk assessment is vital for survival in complex environments with potential threats. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The intricate balance of gene regulation and expression across different brain regions is related to the structure and function of specific neuron subtypes. In particular, excitation/inhibition imbalance caused by hyperexcitability of glutamatergic neurons and/or dysfunction of GABAergic neurons, have been implicated in epilepsy. First, we estimated the risk assessment (RA) by evaluating the behavior of mice in the center of the elevated plus maze, and found that the kainic acid-induced temporal lobe epilepsy mice were specifically impaired their RA. This experiment evaluated approach-RA, with a forthcoming approach to the open arm, and avoid-RA, with forthcoming avoidance of the open arm. Next, results from free-moving electrophysiological recordings showed that in the hippocampus, ∼7% of putative glutamatergic neurons and ∼15% of putative GABAergic neurons were preferentially responsive to either approach-risk assessment or avoid-risk assessment, respectively. In addition, ∼12% and ∼8% of dorsal lateral septum GABAergic neurons were preferentially responsive to approach-risk assessment and avoid-risk assessment, respectively. Notably, during the impaired approach-risk assessment, the favorably activated dorsal dentate gyrus and CA3 glutamatergic neurons increased (∼9%) and dorsal dentate gyrus and CA3 GABAergic neurons decreased (∼7%) in the temporal lobe epilepsy mice. Then, we used RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining to investigate which subtype of GABAergic neuron loss may contribute to excitation/inhibition imbalance. The results show that temporal lobe epilepsy mice exhibit significant neuronal loss and reorganization of neural networks. In particular, the dorsal dentate gyrus and CA3 somatostatin-positive neurons and dorsal lateral septum cholecystokinin-positive neurons are selectively vulnerable to damage after temporal lobe epilepsy. Optogenetic activation of the hippocampal glutamatergic neurons or chemogenetic inhibition of the hippocampal somatostatin neurons directly disrupts RA, suggesting that an excitation/inhibition imbalance in the dHPC dorsal lateral septum circuit results in the impairment of RA behavior. Taken together, this study provides insight into epilepsy and its comorbidity at different levels, including molecular, cell, neural circuit, and behavior, which are expected to decrease injury and premature mortality in patients with epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The immune system plays essential roles in maintaining homeostasis in mammalian tissues that extend beyond pathogen clearance and host defense. Recently, several homeostatic circuits comprised of paired hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells have been described to influence tissue composition and turnover in development and after perturbation. Crucial circuit components include innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which seed developing organs and shape their resident tissues by influencing progenitor fate decisions, microbial interactions, and neuronal activity. As they develop in tissues, ILCs undergo transcriptional imprinting that encodes receptivity to corresponding signals derived from their resident tissues but ILCs can also shift their transcriptional profiles to adapt to specific types of tissue perturbation. Thus, ILC functions are embedded within their resident tissues, where they constitute key regulators of homeostatic responses that can lead to both beneficial and pathogenic outcomes. Here, we examine the interactions between ILCs and various non-hematopoietic tissue cells, and discuss how specific ILC-tissue cell circuits form essential elements of tissue immunity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neurons and synapses manifest pronounced variability in the amount of plasticity induced by identical activity patterns. The mechanisms underlying such plasticity heterogeneity, which have been implicated in context-specific resource allocation during encoding, have remained unexplored. Here, we employed a systematic physiologically constrained parametric search to identify the cellular mechanisms behind plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells. We used heterogeneous model populations to ensure that our conclusions were not biased by parametric choices in a single hand-tuned model. We found that each of intrinsic, synaptic, and structural heterogeneities independently yielded heterogeneities in synaptic plasticity profiles obtained with two different induction protocols. However, among the disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities, our analyses demonstrated the dominance of neurogenesis-induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in granule cells. We found that strong relationships between neuronal intrinsic excitability and plasticity emerged only when adult neurogenesis-induced heterogeneities in neural structure were accounted for. Importantly, our analyses showed that it was not imperative that the manifestation of neural-circuit heterogeneities must translate to heterogeneities in plasticity profiles. Specifically, despite the expression of heterogeneities in structural, synaptic, and intrinsic neuronal properties, similar plasticity profiles were attainable across all models through synergistic interactions among these heterogeneities. We assessed the parametric combinations required for the manifestation of such degeneracy in the expression of plasticity profiles. We found that immature cells showed physiological plasticity profiles despite receiving afferent inputs with weak synaptic strengths. Thus, the high intrinsic excitability of immature granule cells was sufficient to counterbalance their low excitatory drive in the expression of plasticity profile degeneracy. Together, our analyses demonstrate that disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities could mechanistically drive plasticity heterogeneity, but also caution against treating neural-circuit heterogeneities as proxies for plasticity heterogeneity. Our study emphasizes the need for quantitatively characterizing the relationship between neural-circuit and plasticity heterogeneities across brain regions.',\n",

Activity in the anterior piriform cortex (APC) is largely driven by ipsilateral neural activity from the olfactory bulb and is a suitable system for examining the effects of sensory experience on cortical circuits. Pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can modulate excitatory and inhibitory synapses, but its role in APC is unexplored. Here we examined the role of TNF-α in adjusting synapses in the mouse APC after experience deprivation via unilateral naris occlusion. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that activity deprivation increased excitatory, and decreased inhibitory, synaptic density in wild-type mice, consistent with homeostatic regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that naris occlusion increased the expression of Tnf mRNA in APC. Critically, occlusion-induced plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses was completely blocked in the Tnf knockout mouse. Together, these results show that TNF-α is an important orchestrator of experience-dependent plasticity in the APC.',\n",

Here, we investigated neuronal activity dynamics of parvalbumin (PV), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SST) neurons in naturally-sleeping head-restrained mice at the level of layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of mice. Through calcium-imaging and targeted single-unit loose-patch or whole-cell recordings, we found that PV action potential (AP) firing activity was largest during both NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM sleep stages, that VIP neurons were most active during REM sleep and that the overall activity of SST neurons remained stable throughout the sleep/wake cycle. Analysis of neuronal activity dynamics uncovered rapid decreases in PV cell firing at wake onset followed by a progressive recovery during wake. Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings further revealed that, except for SST neurons, a large proportion of neurons were modulated by ongoing delta and theta oscillations. During NREM sleep spindles, PV and SST activity increased and decreased, respectively. Finally, we uncovered the presence of whisking behavior in mice during REM sleep and show that the activity of VIP and SST is differentially modulated during awake and sleeping whisking bouts, which may provide a neuronal substrate for internal brain representations occurring during sleep.In the sensory cortex, the balance between excitation and inhibition is believed to be highly dynamic throughout the sleep/wake cycle, shaping the response of cortical circuits to external stimuli, while allowing the formation of newly encoded memory. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging or targeted single-unit recordings combined with local field potential recordings, we describe the vigilance state and whisking-behavior -dependent activity of excitatory pyramidal and inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the supragranular layers of mouse somatosensory cortex. Interneuronal activity was found to be differentially modulated by ongoing delta and theta waves, sleep spindles and a novel type of whisking observed during Rapid Eye Movement (REM sleep), potentially providing a neuronal substrate for internal brain representations occurring during sleep.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent models of spiking neuronal networks have been trained to perform behaviors in static environments using a variety of learning rules, with varying degrees of biological realism. Most of these models have not been tested in dynamic visual environments where models must make predictions on future states and adjust their behavior accordingly. The models using these learning rules are often treated as black boxes, with little analysis on circuit architectures and learning mechanisms supporting optimal performance. Here we developed visual/motor spiking neuronal network models and trained them to play a virtual racket-ball game using several reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by the dopaminergic reward system. We systematically investigated how different architectures and circuit-motifs (feed-forward, recurrent, feedback) contributed to learning and performance. We also developed a new biologically-inspired learning rule that significantly enhanced performance, while reducing training time. Our models included visual areas encoding game inputs and relaying the information to motor areas, which used this information to learn to move the racket to hit the ball. Neurons in the early visual area relayed information encoding object location and motion direction across the network. Neuronal association areas encoded spatial relationships between objects in the visual scene. Motor populations received inputs from visual and association areas representing the dorsal pathway. Two populations of motor neurons generated commands to move the racket up or down. Model-generated actions updated the environment and triggered reward or punishment signals that adjusted synaptic weights so that the models could learn which actions led to reward. Here we demonstrate that our biologically-plausible learning rules were effective in training spiking neuronal network models to solve problems in dynamic environments. We used our models to dissect the circuit architectures and learning rules most effective for learning. Our model shows that learning mechanisms involving different neural circuits produce similar performance in sensory-motor tasks. In biological networks, all learning mechanisms may complement one another, accelerating the learning capabilities of animals.

       "  'abstract': 'Alterations in the structure and functional connectivity of anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) have been linked to reduced cognition during aging. However, ATN circuits that contribute to higher cognitive functions remain understudied. We found that the anteroventral (AV) subdivision of ATN is necessary specifically during the maintenance phase of a spatial working memory task. This function engages the AV→parasubiculum (PaS)→entorhinal cortex (EC) circuit. Aged mice showed a deficit in spatial working memory, which was associated with a decrease in the excitability of AV neurons. Activation of AV neurons or the AV→PaS circuit in aged mice was sufficient to rescue their working memory performance. Furthermore, rescued aged mice showed improved behavior-induced neuronal activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC), a critical site for working memory processes. Although the direct activation of PFC neurons in aged mice also rescued their working memory performance, we found that these animals exhibited increased levels of anxiety, which was not the case for AV→PaS circuit manipulations in aged mice. These results suggest that targeting AV thalamus in aging may not only be beneficial for cognitive functions but that this approach may have fewer unintended effects compared to direct PFC manipulations.',\n",

Synaptic connections continue to undergo experience-dependent structural rearrangements throughout life, which are postulated to underlie learning and memory. Astrocytes, a major glial cell type in the brain, are physically in contact with synaptic circuits through their structural ensheathment of synapses. Astrocytes strongly contribute to the remodeling of synaptic structures in healthy and diseased central nervous systems by regulating synaptic connectivity and behaviors. However, whether structural plasticity of astrocytes is involved in their critical functions at the synapse is unknown. This review will discuss the emerging evidence linking astrocytic structural plasticity to synaptic circuit remodeling and regulation of behaviors.

       "  'abstract': 'The functions of cortical networks are progressively established during development by series of events shaping the neuronal connectivity. Synaptic elimination, which consists of removing the supernumerary connections generated during the earlier stages of cortical development, is one of the latest stages in neuronal network maturation. The semaphorin 3F coreceptors neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) and plexin-A3 (PlxnA3) may play an important role in the functional maturation of the cerebral cortex by regulating the excess dendritic spines on cortical excitatory neurons. Yet, the identity of the connections eliminated under the control of Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling is debated, and the importance of this synaptic refinement for cortical functions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Nrp2/PlxnA3 controls the spine densities in layer 4 (L4) and on the apical dendrite of L5 neurons of the sensory and motor cortices. Using a combination of neuroanatomical,  electrophysiology, and  functional imaging techniques in  and  KO mice of both sexes, we disprove the hypothesis that Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling is required to maintain the ectopic thalamocortical connections observed during embryonic development. We also show that the absence of Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling leads to the hyperexcitability and excessive synchronization of the neuronal activity in L5 and L4 neuronal networks, suggesting that this system could participate in the refinement of the recurrent corticocortical connectivity in those layers. Altogether, our results argue for a role of semaphorin-Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling in the proper maturation and functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex, likely by controlling the refinement of recurrent corticocortical connections. The function of a neuronal circuit is mainly determined by the connections that neurons establish with one another during development. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the establishment of the functional connectivity is fundamental to comprehend how network functions are implemented, and to design treatments aiming at restoring damaged neuronal circuits. Here, we show that the cell surface receptors for the family of semaphorin guidance cues neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) and plexin-A3 (PlxnA3) play an important role in shaping the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex likely by trimming the recurrent connections in layers 4 and 5. By removing the supernumerary inputs generated during early development, Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling reduces the neuronal excitability and participates in the maturation of the cortical network functions.',\n",

Despite rich knowledge in retinal circuits, the long-range connectivity map from distinct retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types to diverse brain neuron types remains unknown.

Trans-Seq combines a fluorescent anterograde trans-synaptic tracer, consisting of codon-optimized wheat germ agglutinin fused to mCherry, with single-cell RNA sequencing. We used Trans-Seq to classify SC neuron types innervated by genetically defined RGC types and predicted a neuronal pair from αRGCs to Nephronectin-positive wide-field neurons (NPWFs). We validated this connection using genetic labeling, electrophysiology and retrograde tracing. We then used transcriptomic data from Trans-Seq to identify Nephronectin as a determinant for selective synaptic choice from αRGC to NPWFs via binding to Integrin α8β1.

Such learning is often characterized by a \"moment of insight,\" an abrupt and dramatic improvement in recognition. The mechanisms that support abrupt learning are unknown, but one hypothesis is that they involve changes in synchronization between brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we used a behavioral task in which non-human primates rapidly learned to recognize novel images and to associate them with specific responses. Simultaneous recordings from inferotemporal and prefrontal cortices revealed a transient synchronization of neural activity between these areas that peaked around the moment of insight. Synchronization was strongest between inferotemporal sites that encoded images and reward-sensitive prefrontal sites.

       "  'abstract': 'Neural circuit function underlies cognition, sensation, and behavior. Proper circuit assembly depends on the identity of the neurons in the circuit (gene expression, morphology, synapse targeting, and biophysical properties). Neuronal identity is established by spatial and temporal patterning mechanisms, but little is known about how these mechanisms drive circuit formation in postmitotic neurons. Temporal patterning involves the sequential expression of transcription factors (TFs) in neural progenitors to diversify neuronal identity, in part through the initial expression of homeodomain TF combinations. Here, we address the role of the Drosophila temporal TF Hunchback and the homeodomain TF Bicoid in the assembly of the Pair1 (SEZ_DN1) descending neuron locomotor circuit, which promotes larval pausing and head casting. We find that both Hunchback and Bicoid are expressed in larval Pair1 neurons, Hunchback activates Bicoid in Pair1 (opposite of their embryonic relationship), and the loss of Hunchback function or Bicoid function from Pair1 leads to ectopic presynapse numbers in Pair1 axons and an increase in Pair1-induced pausing behavior. These phenotypes are highly specific, as the loss of Bicoid or Hunchback has no effect on Pair1 neurotransmitter identity, dendrite morphology, or axonal morphology. Importantly, the loss of Hunchback or Bicoid in Pair1 leads to the addition of new circuit partners that may underlie the exaggerated locomotor pausing behavior. These data are the first to show a role for Bicoid outside of embryonic patterning and the first to demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for Hunchback and Bicoid in interneuron synapse targeting and locomotor behavior.',\n",

While presynaptic neurons were shown to play instructive roles for the postsynaptic neurons, how postsynaptic neurons provide feedback to regulate the presynaptic neuronal development remains elusive. To elucidate the mechanisms for circuit formation, we study the development of barrel cortex (the primary sensory cortex, S1), whose development is instructed by presynaptic thalamocortical axons (TCAs). In the first postnatal weeks, TCA terminals arborize in layer (L) 4 to fill in the barrel center, but it is unclear how TCA development is regulated. Here, we reported that the deletion of Lhx2 specifically in the cortical neurons in the conditional knockout (cKO) leads to TCA arborization defects, which is accompanied with deficits in sensory-evoked and spontaneous cortical activities and impaired lesion-induced plasticity following early whisker follicle ablation. Reintroducing Lhx2 back in L4 neurons in cKO ameliorated TCA arborization and plasticity defects. By manipulating L4 neuronal activity, we further demonstrated that Lhx2 induces TCA arborization via an activity-dependent mechanism. Additionally, we identified the extracellular signaling protein Sema7a as an activity-dependent downstream target of Lhx2 in regulating TCA branching. Thus, we discovered a bottom-up feedback mechanism for the L4 neurons to regulate TCA development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Oestradiol establishes neural sex differences in many vertebrates and modulates mood, behaviour and energy balance in adulthood. In the canonical pathway, oestradiol exerts its effects through the transcription factor oestrogen receptor-α (ERα). Although ERα has been extensively characterized in breast cancer, the neuronal targets of ERα, and their involvement in brain sex differences, remain largely unknown. Here we generate a comprehensive map of genomic ERα-binding sites in a sexually dimorphic neural circuit that mediates social behaviours. We conclude that ERα orchestrates sexual differentiation of the mouse brain through two mechanisms: establishing two male-biased neuron types and activating a sustained male-biased gene expression program. Collectively, our findings reveal that sex differences in gene expression are defined by hormonal activation of neuronal steroid receptors. The molecular targets we identify may underlie the effects of oestradiol on brain development, behaviour and disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '. In the theoretical framework of predictive coding and active inference, the brain can be viewed as instantiating a rich generative model of the world that predicts incoming sensory data while continuously updating its parameters via minimization of prediction errors. While this theory has been successfully applied to cognitive processes-by modelling the activity of functional neural networks at a mesoscopic scale-the validity of the approach when modelling neurons as an ensemble of inferring agents, in a biologically plausible architecture, remained to be explored.We modelled a simplified cerebellar circuit with individual neurons acting as Bayesian agents to simulate the classical delayed eyeblink conditioning protocol. Neurons and synapses adjusted their activity to minimize their prediction error, which was used as the network cost function. This cerebellar network was then implemented in hardware by replicating digital neuronal elements via a low-power microcontroller.. Persistent changes of synaptic strength-that mirrored neurophysiological observations-emerged via local (neurocentric) prediction error minimization, leading to the expression of associative learning. The same paradigm was effectively emulated in low-power hardware showing remarkably efficient performance compared to conventional neuromorphic architectures.. These findings show that: (a) an ensemble of free energy minimizing neurons-organized in a biological plausible architecture-can recapitulate functional self-organization observed in nature, such as associative plasticity, and (b) a neuromorphic network of inference units can learn unsupervised tasks without embedding predefined learning rules in the circuit, thus providing a potential avenue to a novel form of brain-inspired artificial intelligence.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Deterioration in the quality of a person's voice and speech is an early marker of Parkinson's disease (PD). In humans, the neural circuit that supports vocal motor control consists of a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortico loop. The basal ganglia regions, striatum and globus pallidus, in this loop play a role in modulating the acoustic features of vocal behavior such as loudness, pitch, and articulatory rate. In PD, this area is implicated in pathogenesis. In animal models of PD, the accumulation of toxic aggregates containing the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein (αsyn) in the midbrain and striatum result in limb and vocal motor impairments. It has been challenging to study vocal impairments given the lack of well-defined cortico-basal ganglia circuitry for vocalization in rodent models. Furthermore, whether deterioration of voice quality early in PD is a direct result of αsyn-induced neuropathology is not yet known. Here, we take advantage of the well-characterized vocal circuits of the adult male zebra finch songbird to experimentally target a song-dedicated pathway, the anterior forebrain pathway, using an adeno-associated virus expressing the human wild-type αsyn gene, SNCA. We found that overexpression of αsyn in this pathway coincides with higher levels of insoluble, monomeric αsyn compared to control finches. Impairments in song production were also detected along with shorter and poorer quality syllables, which are the most basic unit of song. These vocal changes are similar to the vocal abnormalities observed in individuals with PD.\",\n",

To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals of both sexes, replicating in vitro an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles in vivo. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we found that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increased their correlated activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Optogenetic and electrical stimulation also induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed unexpected strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reductions in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance reverted this effect. These significant increases in excitability can explain the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We conclude that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an 'iceberg' model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuropathic pain is often chronic and can persist after overt tissue damage heals, suggesting that its underlying mechanism involves the alteration of neuronal function. Such an alteration can be a direct consequence of nerve damage or a result of neuroplasticity secondary to the damage to tissues or to neurons. Recent studies have shown that neuroplasticity is linked to causing neuropathic pain in response to nerve damage, which may occur adjacent to or remotely from the site of injury. Furthermore, studies have revealed that neuroplasticity relevant to chronic pain is modulated by microglia, resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia may directly contribute to synaptic remodeling and altering pain circuits, or indirectly contribute to neuroplasticity through property changes, including the secretion of growth factors. We herein highlight the mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity that occur in the somatosensory circuit of the spinal dorsal horn, thalamus, and cortex associated with chronic pain following injury to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or CNS. We also discuss the dynamic functions of microglia in shaping neuroplasticity related to chronic pain. We suggest further understanding of post-injury ectopic plasticity in the somatosensory circuits may shed light on the differential mechanisms underlying nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic-type pain. While one of the prominent roles played by microglia appears to be the modulation of post-injury neuroplasticity. Therefore, future molecular- or genetics-based studies that address microglia-mediated post-injury neuroplasticity may contribute to the development of novel therapies for chronic pain.',\n",

The 9-month-old TgF344-AD rats exhibited loss of neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.

The hippocampal PVB circuit underwent neuroplastic reorganization with increased dendritic length and complexity in 9- and 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats, before atrophy at 15\\xa0months. Strikingly, 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats were resilient in executive function and cognitive flexibility. Cognitive resilience in TgF344-AD rats occurred as maintenance of function between 9 and 12\\xa0months of age despite progressive spatial memory deficits, and was sustained by PVB neuroplasticity.

Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes over time during these tasks. All reported HPC in vivo calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice. In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) in vivo calcium imaging from CA1 hippocampus in freely moving male rats. Using the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that, in rat, hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks. We show that calcium events in these cells are highly correlated with periods of movement, with few calcium events occurring during periods without movement. We additionally show that an extremely large percent of cells recorded during a navigational task are place cells (77.3±5.0%, surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging), and that these cells enable accurate decoding of animal position and can be held over days with consistent place fields in a consistent spatial map. A detailed protocol is included, and implications of these advancements on  imaging and place field literature are discussed.In vivo calcium imaging in freely moving animals allows the visualization of cellular activity across days.

At present no effective treatment options are available; current therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) improve cognitive symptoms only transiently and in a minor number of patients. Further, most of the amyloid-based phase III clinical trials recently failed in AD, in spite of promising preclinical and phase I-II clinical trials, further pinpointing the need for a better knowledge of the early mechanisms of disease as well as of more effective routes of drug administration. In fact, beyond common pathological events and molecular substrates, each of these diseases preferentially affect defined subpopulations of neurons in specific neuronal circuits (selective neuronal vulnerability), leading to the typical age-related clinical profile. In this perspective, key to successful drug discovery is a robust and reproducible biological validation of potential new molecular targets together with a concomitant set up of protocols/tools for efficient and targeted brain delivery to a specific area of interest. Here we propose and discuss Focused UltraSound aided drug administration as a specific and novel technical approach to achieve optimal concentration of the drug at the target area of interest.

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding the operation of cortical circuits is an important and necessary task in both neuroscience and neurorehabilitation. The functioning of the neocortex results from integrative neuronal activity, which can be probed non-invasively by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Despite a clear indication of the direct involvement of cortical neurons in TMS, no explicit connection model has been made between the microscopic neuronal landscape and the macroscopic TMS outcome. Here we have performed an integrative review of multidisciplinary evidence regarding motor cortex neurocytology and TMS-related neurophysiology with the aim of elucidating the micro-macro connections underlying TMS. Neurocytological evidence from animal and human studies has been reviewed to describe the landscape of the cortical neurons covering the taxonomy, morphology, circuit wiring, and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Evidence from TMS studies in healthy humans is discussed, with emphasis on the TMS pulse and paradigm selectivity that reflect the underlying neural circuitry constitution. As a result, we propose a preliminary neuronal model of the human motor cortex and then link the TMS mechanisms with the neuronal model by stimulus intensity, direction of induced current, and paired-pulse timing. As TMS bears great developmental potential for both a probe and modulator of neural network activity and neurotransmission, the connection model will act as a foundation for future combined studies of neurocytology and neurophysiology, as well as the technical advances and application of TMS.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Obesity, a growing threat to the modern society, represents an imbalance of metabolic queues that normally signal to the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, a critical brain region sensing and regulating energy homeostasis. This is achieved by various neurons many of which developmentally originate from the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing lineage. Within the mature neurons originating from this lineage, we aimed to identify non-coding genes in control of metabolic function in the adulthood. In this work, we used microRNA mimic delivery and POMC-dependent CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out strategies in young or aged mice. Importantly, we also used CRISPR guides directing suicide cleavage of Cas9 to limit the off-target effects. Here we found that mature neurons originating from the POMC lineage employ miR-29a to protect against insulin resistance obesity, hyperphagia, decreased energy expenditure and obesity. Moreover, we validated the miR-29 family as a prominent regulator of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Within the latter, we identified a direct target of miR-29a-3p, Nras, which was up-regulated in those and only those mature POMCCas9 neurons that were effectively transduced by anti-miR-29 CRISPR-equipped construct. Moreover, POMC-dependent co-deletion of Nras in mature neurons attenuated miR-29 depletion-induced obesity. Thus, the first to our knowledge case of in situ Cre-dependent CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-out of microRNAs in a specific hypothalamic neuronal population helped us to decipher a critical metabolic circuit in adult mice. This work significantly extends our understanding about the involvement of neuronal microRNAs in homeostatic regulation. ',\n",

However, the in\\xa0vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating ripple-related activity among local and distant neuronal ensembles are not well understood. Here, we define key characteristics of a long-distance projecting GABAergic cell group in the mouse hippocampus that selectively exhibits high-frequency firing during ripples while staying largely silent during theta-associated states when most other GABAergic cells are active. The high ripple-associated firing commenced before ripple onset and reached its maximum before ripple peak, with the signature theta-OFF, ripple-ON firing pattern being preserved across awake and sleep states. Controlled by septal GABAergic, cholinergic, and CA3 glutamatergic inputs, these ripple-selective cells innervate parvalbumin and cholecystokinin-expressing local interneurons while also targeting a variety of extra-hippocampal regions.

       "  'abstract': 'The nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (RE) is a pivotal area responsible for the connectivity of the prefrontal-hippocampus pathway that regulates cognitive, executive, and fear learning processes. Recently, it was proposed that the RE participates in the pathophysiological states related to affective dysregulation. We investigated the role of RE in motivational behavioral and electrophysiological dysregulation induced by stress. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a combination of stressors (restraint stress+footshock) for 10 days and tested one to two\\xa0weeks later in the forced swim test (FST), ventral tegmental area (VTA)dopamine (DA) neuron electrophysiological activity, and hippocampal-nucleus accumbens plasticity. The RE was inactivated by injecting TTX prior to the procedures. The stress exposure increased the immobility in the FST and decreased VTA DA neuron population activity. Whereas an early long-term potentiation (e-LTP) in the ventral hippocampus-nucleus accumbens pathway was found after fimbria high-frequency stimulation in naïve animals, stressed animals showed an early long-term depression (e-LTD). Inactivation of the RE reversed the stress-induced changes in the FST and restored dopaminergic activity. RE inactivation partially recovered the stress-induced abnormal hippocampal-accumbens plasticity observed in controls. Our findings support the role of the RE in regulating affective dysregulation and blunted VTA DA system function induced by stress. Also, it points to the hippocampal-accumbens pathway as a potential neural circuit through which RE could modulate activity. Therefore, RE may represent a key brain region involved in the neurobiology of amotivational states and may provide insights into circuit dysfunction and markers of the maladaptive stress response.',\n",

One of the prime functions of interneurons is to stabilize the circuit by feedback inhibition, but the level of specificity on which inhibitory feedback operates is not fully resolved. We hypothesized that inhibitory circuits could enable separate feedback control loops for different synaptic input streams, by means of specific feedback inhibition to different neuronal compartments. To investigate this hypothesis, we adopted an optimization approach. Leveraging recent advances in training spiking network models, we optimized the connectivity and short-term plasticity of interneuron circuits for compartment-specific feedback inhibition onto pyramidal neurons. Over the course of the optimization, the interneurons diversified into two classes that resembled parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we show that the resulting circuit can be understood as a neural decoder that inverts the nonlinear biophysical computations performed within the pyramidal cells. Our model provides a proof of concept for studying structure-function relations in cortical circuits by a combination of gradient-based optimization and biologically plausible phenomenological models.',\n",

This greatly increases flexibility, resolution, targeting specificity and throughput compared with alternative approaches based on electrophysiology and/or one-photon optogenetics and can interrogate larger and more densely labeled populations of neurons than current voltage imaging-based implementations. This protocol describes the experimental workflow for all-optical interrogation experiments in awake, behaving head-fixed mice. We describe modular procedures for the setup and calibration of an all-optical system (~3 h), the preparation of an indicator and opsin-expressing and task-performing animal (~3-6 weeks), the characterization of functional and photostimulation responses (~2 h per field of view) and the design and implementation of an all-optical experiment (achievable within the timescale of a normal behavioral experiment; ~3-5 h per field of view). We discuss optimizations for efficiently selecting and targeting neuronal ensembles for photostimulation sequences, as well as generating photostimulation response maps from the imaging data that can be used to examine the impact of photostimulation on the local circuit. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy in three brain areas by using different experimental setups.

       "  'abstract': 'Abnormal fear and anxiety can manifest as psychiatric disorders. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in sustained responding to, or anticipation of, an aversive event which can be expressed as anticipatory anxiety. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is also active during anticipatory anxiety and sends projections to the BNST. However, little is known about the role for BLA neurons that project to BNST (BLA-BNST) in anticipatory anxiety in rodents. To address this, we tested if chemogenetic inactivation of the BLA-BNST pathway attenuates sustained conditioned responses produced by anticipation of an aversive stimulus. For comparison, we also assessed BLA-BNST inactivation during social interaction, which is sensitive to unlearned anxiety. We found that BLA-BNST inactivation reduced conditioned sustained freezing and increased social behaviors, but surprisingly, only in males. To determine if sex differences in BLA-BNST neuronal activity contribute to the differences in behavior, we used  and  electrophysiological approaches. In males, BLA-BNST projection neurons were more active and excitable which coincided with a smaller afterhyperpolarization current ( ) compared to other BLA neurons; whereas in females, BLA-BNST neurons were less excitable and had larger   compared to other BLA neurons. These findings demonstrate that activity of BLA-BNST neurons mediates conditioned anticipatory anxiety-like behavior in males. The lack of a role of BLA-BNST in females in this behavior, possibly due to low excitability of these neurons, also highlights the need for caution when generalizing the role of specific neurocircuits in fear and anxiety.  Anxiety disorders disproportionately affect women. This hints towards sex differences within anxiety neurocircuitry, yet most of our understanding is derived from male rodents. Furthermore, debilitating anticipation of adverse events is among the most severe anxiety symptoms, but little is known about anticipatory anxiety neurocircuitry. Here we demonstrated that BLA-BNST activity is required for anticipatory anxiety to a prolonged aversive cue, but only in males. Moreover, BLA-BNST neurons are hypoactive and less excitable in females. These results uncover BLA-BNST as a key component of anticipatory anxiety circuitry, and cellular differences may explain the sex-dependent role of this circuit. Uncovering this disparity provides evidence that the assumed basic circuitry of an anxiety behavior might not readily transpose from males to females.',\n",

As plaques lack innervation, the effects of neuronal control on atherosclerosis remain unclear.

Here, because the peripheral nervous system uses the adventitia as its principal conduit to reach distant targets, we postulated that the peripheral nervous system may directly interact with diseased arteries. Unexpectedly, widespread neuroimmune\\xa0cardiovascular interfaces (NICIs) arose in mouse and human atherosclerosis-diseased adventitia segments showed expanded axon networks, including growth cones at axon endings near immune cells and media smooth muscle cells. Mouse NICIs established a structural artery-brain circuit (ABC): abdominal adventitia nociceptive afferents entered the central nervous system through spinal cord T-T dorsal root ganglia and were traced to higher brain regions, including the parabrachial and central amygdala neurons; and sympathetic efferent neurons projected from medullary and hypothalamic neurons to the adventitia through spinal intermediolateral neurons and both coeliac and sympathetic chain ganglia. Moreover, ABC peripheral nervous system components were activated: splenic sympathetic and coeliac vagus nerve activities increased in\\xa0parallel to disease progression, whereas coeliac ganglionectomy led to the disintegration of adventitial NICIs, reduced disease progression and enhanced plaque stability. Thus, the peripheral nervous system uses NICIs to assemble a structural ABC, and therapeutic intervention in the ABC attenuates atherosclerosis.',\n",

However, the neuronal circuit responsible for modulating gut microbiota remained unclear. Using genetic mouse models and 16s rRNA metagenomic analysis, we find that light-dark cycle information transmitted by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is essential for daily oscillations of gut microbes under temporal restricted high-fat diet conditions. Furthermore, aberrant light exposure such as dim light at night (dLAN) can alter the composition, relative abundance, and daily oscillations of gut microbiota. Together, our results indicate that external light-dark cycle information can modulate gut microbiota in the direction from the brain to the gut via the sensory system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Control of musculoskeletal systems depends on integration of voluntary commands and somatosensory feedback in the complex neural circuits of the spinal cord. It has been suggested that the various connectivity patterns that have been identified experimentally may result from the many transcriptional types that have been observed in spinal interneurons. We ask instead whether the muscle-specific details of observed connectivity patterns can arise as a consequence of Hebbian adaptation during early development, rather than being genetically ordained. We constructed an anatomically simplified model musculoskeletal system with realistic muscles and sensors and connected it to a recurrent, random neuronal network consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons endowed with Hebbian learning rules. We then generated a wide set of randomized muscle twitches typical of those described during fetal development and allowed the network to learn. Multiple simulations consistently resulted in diverse and stable patterns of activity and connectivity that included subsets of the interneurons that were similar to \"archetypical\" interneurons described in the literature. We also found that such learning led to an increased degree of cooperativity between interneurons when performing larger limb movements on which it had not been trained. Hebbian learning gives rise to rich sets of diverse interneurons whose connectivity reflects the mechanical properties of the system. At least some of the transcriptomic diversity may reflect the effects of this process rather than the cause of the connectivity. Such a learning process seems better suited to respond to the musculoskeletal mutations that underlie the evolution of new species. We present a model of a self-organizing early spinal cord circuitry, which is attached to a biologically realistic sensorized musculoskeletal system. Without any a priori-defined connectivity or organization, learning induced by spontaneous, fetal-like motor activity results in the emergence of a well-functioning spinal interneuronal circuit whose connectivity patterns resemble in many respects those observed in the adult mammalian spinal cord. Hence, our result questions the importance of genetically controlled wiring for spinal cord function.',\n",

We also discuss different methods to obtain estimates of the model's parameters from experimental recordings. Next, we show that, indeed, new dynamical regimes appear in the presence of short-term synaptic plasticity. In particular, model neuronal networks exhibit the co-existence of a stable fixed point and a stable limit cycle in the presence of short-term synaptic facilitation. It has been suggested that this dynamical regime is especially relevant in working memory processes. We provide, then, a short summary of the synaptic theory of working memory and discuss some of its specific predictions in the context of experiments.

This reinforces the idea that astrocytes not only provide the \"housekeeping\" for the neurons, but that they also play a vital role in supporting and expanding the functions of brain circuits and networks. Despite this accumulated knowledge, the field of computational neuroscience has mostly focused on modeling neuronal functions, ignoring the glial cells and the interactions they have with the neurons.

       "  'abstract': 'The first step toward understanding the brain is to learn how individual neurons process incoming signals, the vast majority of which arrive in their dendrites. Dendrites were first discovered at the beginning of the twentieth century and were characterized by great anatomical variability, both within and across species. Over the past years, a rich repertoire of active and passive dendritic mechanisms has been unveiled, which greatly influences their integrative power. Yet, our understanding of how dendrites compute remains limited, mainly because technological limitations make it difficult to record from dendrites directly and manipulate them. Computational modeling, on the other hand, is perfectly suited for this task. Biophysical models that account for the morphology as well as passive and active neuronal properties can explain a wide variety of experimental findings, shedding new light on how dendrites contribute to neuronal and circuit computations. This chapter aims to help the interested reader build biophysical models incorporating dendrites by detailing how their electrophysiological properties can be described using simple mathematical frameworks. We start by discussing the passive properties of dendrites and then give an overview of how active conductances can be incorporated, leading to realistic in silico replicas of biological neurons.',\n",

Among downstream Ca effectors, Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and Ca/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) interactively and competitively regulate essential neuronal functions, such as bidirectional synaptic plasticity, gene expression, learning and memory. New developments in optical imaging and local optical manipulation revealed distinctive spatiotemporal features of bidirectional dendritic spine structural plasticity that are co-regulated by CaMKII and CaN. We created a novel set of genetically-encoded fluorescent probes to specifically investigate key activation processes of CaMKII and CaN in living neurons. Multiplex FRET imaging approaches revealed distinct spatiotemporal properties of CaMKII and CaN co-activation in dendrites and synapses that likely underlie the biochemical machinery to decode information represented in the patterned neuronal input to decide properties of spine structural plasticity. We also created new orthogonal color variants of linearly performing Ca indicators XCaMPs that can be easily multiplexed with a number of other fluorescent probes. These advances facilitate future investigation on how biochemical decoding is achieved in neurons in the living brain, and will shed new light on complex brain information dynamics at the crossroad of neurochemistry, pathophysiology and neuro-inspired engineering.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sensory information is transduced into electrical signals in the periphery by specialized sensory organs, which relay this information to the thalamus and subsequently to cortical primary sensory areas. In the cortex, microcircuits constituted by interconnected pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, distributed throughout the cortical column, form the basic processing units of sensory information underlying sensation. In the mouse, these circuits mature shortly after birth. In the first postnatal week cortical activity is characterized by highly synchronized spontaneous activity. While by the second postnatal week, spontaneous activity desynchronizes and sensory influx increases drastically upon eye opening, as well as with the onset of hearing and active whisking. This influx of sensory stimuli is fundamental for the maturation of functional properties and connectivity in neurons allocated to sensory cortices. In the subsequent developmental period, spanning the first five postnatal weeks, sensory circuits are malleable in response to sensory stimulation in the so-called critical periods. During these critical periods, which vary in timing and duration across sensory areas, perturbations in sensory experience can alter cortical connectivity, leading to long-lasting modifications in sensory processing. The recent advent of intersectional genetics,  calcium imaging and single cell transcriptomics has aided the identification of circuit components in emergent networks. Multiple studies in recent years have sought a better understanding of how genetically-defined neuronal subtypes regulate circuit plasticity and maturation during development. In this review, we discuss the current literature focused on postnatal development and critical periods in the primary auditory (A1), visual (V1), and somatosensory (S1) cortices. We compare the developmental trajectory among the three sensory areas with a particular emphasis on interneuron function and the role of inhibitory circuits in cortical development and function.',\n",

NKCC1, encoded by the  gene, regulates neuronal Cl homeostasis by chloride import working opposite KCC2. The high NKCC1/KCC2 expression ratio decreases in early neural development contributing to GABA shift. Human SLC12A2 loss-of-function mutations were recently associated with a multisystem disorder affecting neural development. However, the multisystem phenotype of rodent  knockout models makes neurodevelopment challenging to study. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)-NTRK2/TrkB signalling controls KCC2 expression during neural development, but its impact on NKCC1 is still controversial. Here, we discuss recent evidence supporting BDNF-TrkB signalling controlling  expression and the GABA shift during hippocampal circuit formation. Namely, specific deletion of / from immature mouse hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) affects their integration and maturation in the hippocampal circuitry and reduces  expression in their target region, the CA3 principal cells, leading to premature GABA shift, ultimately influencing the establishment of functional hippocampal circuitry and animal behaviour in adulthood. Thus, immature DGCs emerge as a potential therapeutic target as GABAergic transmission is vital for specific neural progenitors generating dentate neurogenesis in early development and the mature brain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The main neurotransmitter in the brain responsible for the inhibition of neuronal activity is γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It plays a crucial role in circuit formation during development, both via its primary effects as a neurotransmitter and also as a trophic factor. The GABA receptors (GABARs) are G protein-coupled metabotropic receptors; on one hand, they can influence proliferation and migration; and, on the other, they can inhibit cells by modulating the function of K and Ca channels, doing so on a slower time scale and with a longer-lasting effect compared to ionotropic GABA receptors. GABARs are expressed pre- and post-synaptically, at both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals, thus being able to shape neuronal activity, plasticity, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in response to varying levels of extracellular GABA concentration. Furthermore, given their subunit composition and their ability to form complexes with several associated proteins, GABARs display heterogeneity with regard to their function, which makes them a promising target for pharmacological interventions. This review will describe (i) the latest results concerning GABARs/GABAR-complex structures, their function, and the developmental time course of their appearance and functional integration in the brain, (ii) their involvement in manifestation of various pathophysiological conditions, and (iii) the current status of preclinical and clinical studies involving GABAR-targeting drugs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are thought to occur by dysfunction in the fear and anxiety-related brain circuit, however, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Recent human studies have shown that the right anterior insular cortex (aIC) activity is positively correlated with the severity of PTSD symptoms. Understanding the role of the aIC in fear and anxiety may provide insights into the etiology of anxiety disorders. We used a modified shock-probe defensive burying behavioral test, which utilizes the natural propensity of rodents to bury potentially dangerous objects, to test the role of aIC in fear. Mice exposed to restraint stress exhibited burying of the restrainer-resembling object, indicative of defensive behavior. Electrolytic ablation of the aIC significantly diminished this defensive burying behavior, suggesting the involvement of the aIC. Single-unit recording of pyramidal neurons in the aIC showed that a proportion of neurons which increased activity in the presence of a restrainer-resembling object was significantly correlated with the defensive burying behavior. This correlation was only present in mice exposed to restraint stress. These results suggest that altered neuronal representation in the aIC may regulate fear and anxiety after exposure to a traumatic event. Overall, our result demonstrates that the aIC mediates fear and anxiety and that it could be a potential target for treating anxiety disorders.',\n",

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the leading cause of inherited blindness, is a group of retinal dystrophies characterized by photoreceptor dysfunction and death. The insulin receptor, a key controller of metabolism, also regulates neuronal survival and synaptic formation, maintenance, and activity. Indeed, deficient insulin receptor signaling has been implicated in several brain neurodegenerative pathologies. We present evidence linking impaired insulin receptor signaling with RP. We describe a selective decrease in the levels of the insulin receptor and its downstream effector phospho-S6 in retinal horizontal cell terminals in the rd10 mouse model of RP, as well as aberrant synapses between rod photoreceptors and the postsynaptic terminals of horizontal and bipolar cells. A gene therapy strategy to induce sustained proinsulin, the insulin precursor, production restored retinal insulin receptor signaling, by increasing S6 phosphorylation, without peripheral metabolic consequences. Moreover, proinsulin preserved photoreceptor synaptic connectivity and prolonged visual function in electroretinogram and optomotor tests. These findings point to a disease-modifying role of insulin receptor and support the therapeutic potential of proinsulin in retinitis pigmentosa.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The descending auditory system modulates the ascending system at every level. The final descending, or efferent, stage comprises lateral olivocochlear and medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. MOC somata in the ventral brainstem project axons to the cochlea to synapse onto outer hair cells (OHC), inhibiting OHC-mediated cochlear amplification. MOC suppression of OHC function is implicated in cochlear gain control with changing sound intensity, detection of salient stimuli, attention and protection against acoustic trauma. Thus, sound excites MOC neurons to provide negative feedback of the cochlea. Sound also inhibits MOC neurons via medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons. However, MNTB-MOC synapses exhibit short-term depression, suggesting reduced MNTB-MOC inhibition during sustained stimuli. Further, due to high rates of both baseline and sound-evoked activity in MNTB neurons in vivo, MNTB-MOC synapses may be tonically depressed. To probe this, we characterized short-term plasticity of MNTB-MOC synapses in mouse brain slices. We mimicked in vivo-like temperature and extracellular calcium conditions, and in vivo-like activity patterns of fast synaptic activation rates, sustained activation and prior tonic activity. Synaptic depression was sensitive to extracellular calcium concentration and temperature. During rapid MNTB axon stimulation, postsynaptic currents in MOC neurons summated but with concurrent depression, resulting in smaller, sustained currents, suggesting tonic inhibition of MOC neurons during rapid circuit activity. Low levels of baseline MNTB activity did not significantly reduce responses to subsequent rapid activity that mimics sound stimulation, indicating that, in vivo, MNTB inhibition of MOC neurons persists despite tonic synaptic depression. KEY POINTS: Inhibitory synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) onto medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons exhibit short-term plasticity that is sensitive to calcium and temperature, with enhanced synaptic depression occurring at higher calcium concentrations and at room temperature. High rates of background synaptic activity that mimic the upper limits of spontaneous MNTB activity cause tonic synaptic depression of MNTB-MOC synapses that limits further synaptic inhibition. High rates of activity at MNTB-MOC synapses cause synaptic summation with concurrent depression to yield a response with an initial large amplitude that decays to a tonic inhibition.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pyramidal cell spike block is a common occurrence in migraine with aura and epileptic seizures. In both cases, pyramidal cells experience hyperexcitation with rapidly increasing firing rates, major changes in electrochemistry, and ultimately spike block that temporarily terminates neuronal activity. In cortical spreading depression (CSD), spike block propagates as a slowly traveling wave of inactivity through cortical pyramidal cells, which is thought to precede migraine attacks with aura. In seizures, highly synchronized cortical activity can be interspersed with, or terminated by, spike block. While the identifying characteristic of CSD and seizures is the pyramidal cell hyperexcitation, it is currently unknown how the dynamics of the cortical microcircuits and inhibitory interneurons affect the initiation of hyperexcitation and subsequent spike block.We tested the contribution of cortical inhibitory interneurons to the initiation of spike block using a cortical microcircuit model that takes into account changes in ion concentrations that result from neuronal firing. Our results show that interneuronal inhibition provides a wider dynamic range to the circuit and generally improves stability against spike block. Despite these beneficial effects, strong interneuronal firing contributed to rapidly changing extracellular ion concentrations, which facilitated hyperexcitation and led to spike block first in the interneuron and then in the pyramidal cell. In all cases, a loss of interneuronal firing triggered pyramidal cell spike block. However, preventing interneuronal spike block was insufficient to rescue the pyramidal cell from spike block. Our data thus demonstrate that while the role of interneurons in cortical microcircuits is complex, they are critical to the initiation of pyramidal cell spike block. We discuss the implications that localized effects on cortical interneurons have beyond the isolated microcircuit and their contribution to CSD and epileptic seizures.',\n",

Post-sepsis syndrome includes long-term psychiatric disorders, such as persistent anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, whose neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. Using a reference mouse model of sepsis, we showed that mice that recovered from sepsis further developed anxiety-related behaviours associated with an exaggerated fear memory. In the brain, sepsis induced an acute pathological activation of a specific neuronal population of the central nucleus of the amygdala, which projects to the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Using viral-genetic circuit tracing and in vivo calcium imaging, we observed that sepsis induced persistent changes in the connectivity matrix and in the responsiveness of these central amygdala neurons projecting to the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The transient and targeted silencing of this subpopulation only during the acute phase of sepsis with a viral pharmacogenetic approach, or with the anti-epileptic and neuroprotective drug levetiracetam, prevented the subsequent development of anxiety-related behaviours. Specific inhibition of brain anxiety and fear circuits during the sepsis acute phase constitutes a preventive approach to preclude the post-infection psychiatric outcomes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Torpor is a naturally occurring, hypometabolic, hypothermic state engaged by a wide range of animals in response to imbalance between the supply and demand for nutrients. Recent work has identified some of the key neuronal populations involved in daily torpor induction in mice, in particular, projections from the preoptic area of the hypothalamus to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). The DMH plays a role in thermoregulation, control of energy expenditure, and circadian rhythms, making it well positioned to contribute to the expression of torpor. We used activity-dependent genetic TRAPing techniques to target DMH neurons that were active during natural torpor bouts in female mice. Chemogenetic reactivation of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons in calorie-restricted mice promoted torpor, resulting in longer and deeper torpor bouts. Chemogenetic inhibition of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons did not block torpor entry, suggesting a modulatory role for the DMH in the control of torpor. This work adds to the evidence that the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and the DMH form part of a circuit within the mouse hypothalamus that controls entry into daily torpor. Daily heterotherms, such as mice, use torpor to cope with environments in which the supply of metabolic fuel is not sufficient for the maintenance of normothermia. Daily torpor involves reductions in body temperature, as well as active suppression of heart rate and metabolism. How the CNS controls this profound deviation from normal homeostasis is not known, but a projection from the preoptic area to the dorsomedial hypothalamus has recently been implicated. We demonstrate that the dorsomedial hypothalamus contains neurons that are active during torpor. Activity in these neurons promotes torpor entry and maintenance, but their activation alone does not appear to be sufficient for torpor entry.',\n",

Combining connectomics with circuit and behavioral physiology, recent studies on the color vision of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have focused on the mechanisms underlying early wavelength processing in the optic ganglia. However, the color vision capabilities of D.\\xa0melanogaster are limited, compared with many flower-visiting insects. For example, a butterfly Papilio xuthus has six spectral classes of photoreceptors. Each ommatidium contains nine photoreceptors in one of three fixed combinations, making the eye an array of three spectrally distinct ommatidia types.

What is the neuronal basis of such precise color vision? How does such a system evolve? Addressing these questions requires comparative studies at the circuit level.

       "  'abstract': 'Sound localization involves information analysis in the lateral superior olive (LSO), a conspicuous nucleus in the mammalian auditory brainstem. LSO neurons weigh interaural level differences (ILDs) through precise integration of glutamatergic excitation from the cochlear nucleus (CN) and glycinergic inhibition from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Sound sources can be localized even during sustained perception, an accomplishment that requires robust neurotransmission. Virtually nothing is known about the sustained performance and the temporal precision of MNTB-LSO inputs after postnatal day (P)12 (time of hearing onset) and whether acoustic experience guides development. Here we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to investigate neurotransmission of single MNTB-LSO fibres upon sustained electrical stimulation (1-200\\xa0Hz/60\\xa0s) at P11 and P38 in wild-type (WT) and deaf otoferlin (Otof) knock-out (KO) mice. At P11, WT and KO inputs performed remarkably similarly. In WTs, the performance increased drastically between P11 and P38, e.g. manifested by an 8 to 11-fold higher replenishment rate (RR) of synaptic vesicles and action potential robustness. Together, these changes resulted in reliable and highly precise neurotransmission at frequencies ≤100\\xa0Hz. In contrast, KO inputs performed similarly at both ages, implying impaired synaptic maturation. Computational modelling confirmed the empirical observations and established a reduced RR per release site for P38 KOs. In conclusion, acoustic experience appears to contribute massively to the development of reliable neurotransmission, thereby forming the basis for effective ILD detection. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into experience-dependent maturation of inhibitory neurotransmission and auditory circuits at the synaptic level. KEY POINTS: Inhibitory glycinergic inputs from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO) are involved in sound localization. This brainstem circuit performs reliably throughout life. How such reliability develops is unknown. Here we investigated the role of acoustic experience on the functional maturation of MNTB-LSO inputs at juvenile (postnatal day P11) and young adult ages (P38) employing deaf mice lacking otoferlin (KO). We analysed neurotransmission at single MNTB-LSO fibres in acute brainstem slices employing prolonged high-frequency stimulation (1-200\\xa0Hz/60\\xa0s). At P11, KO inputs still performed normally, as manifested by normal synaptic attenuation, fidelity, replenishment rate, temporal precision and action potential robustness. Between P11 and P38, several synaptic parameters increased substantially in wild-type mice, collectively resulting in high-fidelity and temporally precise neurotransmission. In contrast, maturation of synaptic fidelity was largely absent in KOs after P11.

Human AUTS2 protein has two major isoforms, full-length (1259 aa) and C-terminal (711 aa), the latter produced from an alternative transcription start site in exon 9. Structurally, AUTS2 contains the putative \"AUTS2 domain\" (∼200 aa) conserved among AUTS2 and its ohnologs, fibrosin, and fibrosin-like-1. Also, AUTS2 contains extensive low-complexity sequences and intrinsically disordered regions, features typical of RNA-binding proteins. During development,  is expressed by specific progenitor cell and neuron types, including pyramidal neurons and Purkinje cells. AUTS2 localizes mainly in cell nuclei, where it regulates transcription and RNA metabolism. Some studies have detected AUTS2 in neurites, where it may regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. Neurodevelopmental functions of AUTS2 have been studied in diverse model systems. In zebrafish,  morphants displayed microcephaly. In mice, excision of different  exons (7, 8, or 15) caused distinct phenotypes, variously including neonatal breathing abnormalities, cerebellar hypoplasia, dentate gyrus hypoplasia, EEG abnormalities, and behavioral changes.

Cerebral organoids, derived from an AUTS2 syndrome patient containing a pathogenic missense variant in exon 9, exhibited neocortical growth defects. Emerging technologies for analysis of human cerebral organoids will be increasingly useful for understanding mechanisms underlying AUTS2 syndrome.

In this study, employing graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a conductive interface, an rGO/g-CN/TiO (rGO/CN/TO) ternary nanocoating with photoelectric conversion ability was fabricated on a Ti-based orthopedic implant for photoelectric stimulation of both bone and nerve repair. Compared with g-CN/TiO (CN/TO) and TiO nanocoatings, the ternary nanocoating exhibited stronger visible-light absorption as well as higher transient photocurrent density and open circuit potential under blue LED exposure. The improved photo-electrochemical properties of the ternary nanocoating were attributed to the enhanced separation of photogenerated carriers at the heterointerface. For the tested nanocoatings, introducing blue LED light irradiation enhanced MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic differentiation and neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells.

       "  'abstract': \"It is often thought that the construction of cortical circuits occurs as the result of an elegantly designed process that unfolds sequentially as an animal develops until adult functional networks emerge. In reality, cortical circuits are shaped by evolutionary mechanisms, changes in developmental programmes driven by neuronal activity or epigenetic mechanisms and the need to adapt to the external world, and must pass through several important phases and timely checkpoints as they form. Some cortical cell types serve multiple functions during this developmental journey and are then reused (or 'recycled') to perform different functions in the adult cortex. Understanding the different stages of the cortical construction process and taking into account the ways in which cellular functions change across time and space is therefore essential if we are to build a comprehensive framework of cortical wiring in both health and disease.\",\n",

The brainstem and basal ganglia are key for processing motor information. Both harbour functionally specialized populations stratified on the basis of axonal projections, synaptic inputs and gene expression, revealing a correspondence between circuit anatomy and function at a high level of granularity. Neuronal populations within both structures form multistep processing chains dedicated to the execution of specific movements; however, the connectivity and communication between these two structures is only just beginning to be revealed. The brainstem and basal ganglia are also embedded into wider networks and into systems-level loops. Important networking components include broadcasting neurons in the cortex, cerebellar output neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Action-specific circuits can be enhanced, vetoed, work in synergy or competition with others, or undergo plasticity to allow adaptive behaviour.

       "  'abstract': \"Acute temperature changes can disrupt neuronal activity and coordination with severe consequences for animal behavior and survival. Nonetheless, two rhythmic neuronal circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and their coordination are maintained across a broad temperature range. However, it remains unclear how this temperature robustness is achieved. Here, we dissociate temperature effects on the rhythm generating circuits from those on upstream ganglia. We demonstrate that heat-activated factors extrinsic to the rhythm generators are essential to the slow gastric mill rhythm's temperature robustness and contribute to the temperature response of the fast pyloric rhythm. The gastric mill rhythm crashed when its rhythm generator in the STG was heated. It was restored when upstream ganglia were heated and temperature-matched to the STG. This also increased the activity of the peptidergic modulatory projection neuron (MCN1), which innervates the gastric mill circuit. Correspondingly, MCN1's neuropeptide transmitter stabilized the rhythm and maintained it over a broad temperature range. Extrinsic neuromodulation is thus essential for the oscillatory circuits in the STG and enables neural circuits to maintain function in temperature-compromised conditions. In contrast, integer coupling between pyloric and gastric mill rhythms was independent of whether extrinsic inputs and STG pattern generators were temperature-matched or not, demonstrating that the temperature robustness of the coupling is enabled by properties intrinsic to the rhythm generators. However, at near-crash temperature, integer coupling was maintained only in some animals while it was absent in others. This was true despite regular rhythmic activity in all animals, supporting that degenerate circuit properties result in idiosyncratic responses to environmental challenges.\",\n",

A major unanswered question is if the pathogenic hallmark of LSDs, storage accumulation, induces functional defects directly or is a disease bystander. Also, for most LSDs we do not know the impact of loss of function in individual cell types. Understanding these critical questions are essential to therapy development. Here, we determine the impact of genetic rescue in distinct cell types on neural circuit dysfunction in CLN3 disease, the most common pediatric dementia and a paradigmatic neurodegenerative LSD. We restored Cln3 expression via AAV-mediated gene delivery and conditional genetic rescue in a CLN3 disease mouse model. Surprisingly, we found that low-level rescue of Cln3 expression in neurons alone normalized clinically relevant electrophysiologic markers of network dysfunction, despite the presence of substantial residual histopathology, in contrast to restoring expression in astrocytes. Thus, loss of CLN3 function in neurons, not storage accumulation, underlies neurologic dysfunction in CLN3 disease. This impliesies that storage clearance may be an inappropriate target for therapy development and an ineffectual biomarker.',\n",

Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina) each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening, respectively.\\xa0Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguus for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally colabel neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong colabeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive colabeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production.

The extent of this enhancement was greater at non-optimal frequency sites than at optimal frequency sites.

We first primed hADSCs into neuron-like cells (hADSC-NCs) and then intracerebrally transplanted them into MCAO reperfusion mice to further explore their in vivo survival, migration, integration, fate commitment and involvement in neural circuit rebuilding. The hADSC-NCs survived well and transformed into MAP2-positive, Iba1- or GFAP-negative cells in vivo while maintaining some proliferative ability, indicated by positive Ki67 staining after 4\\xa0weeks. hADSC-NCs could migrate to multiple brain regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus, and further differentiate into mature neurons, as confirmed by action potential elicitation and postsynaptic currents. With the aid of a cell suicide system, hADSC-NCs were proven to have functionally integrated into the hippocampal memory circuit, where they contributed to spatial learning and memory rescue, as indicated by LTP improvement and subsequent GCV-induced relapse. In addition to infarction size shrinkage and movement improvement, MCAO-reperfused mice showed bidirectional immune modulation, including inhibition of the local proinflammatory factors IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, MIP-1β and promotion proinflammatory IP-10, MCP-1, and enhancement of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-15. Overall, hADSC-NCs used as an intermediate autologous cell source for treating stroke can rebuild hippocampus neuronal circuits through cell replacement. ',\n",

For a long time, this structural simplicity has incorrectly led to the idea that anatomical considerations would be sufficient to understand the dynamics of the underlying circuitry. However, recent experimental evidence indicates that cerebellar operations are much more complex than solely predicted by anatomy, due to the crucial role played by neuronal and synaptic properties. To be able to explore neuronal and microcircuit dynamics, advanced imaging, electrophysiological techniques and computational models have been combined, allowing us to investigate neuronal ensembles activity and to connect microscale to mesoscale phenomena. Here, we review what is known about cerebellar network organization, neural dynamics and synaptic plasticity and point out what is still missing and would require experimental assessments. We consider the available experimental techniques that allow a comprehensive assessment of circuit dynamics, including voltage and calcium imaging and extracellular electrophysiological recordings with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). These techniques are proving essential to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of activity and plasticity in the cerebellar network, providing new clues on how circuit dynamics contribute to motor control and higher cognitive functions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'K-Cl transporter KCC2 is an important regulator of neuronal development and neuronal function at maturity. Through its canonical transporter role, KCC2 maintains inhibitory responses mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors. During development, late onset of KCC2 transporter activity defines the period when depolarizing GABAergic signals promote a wealth of developmental processes. In addition to its transporter function, KCC2 directly interacts with a number of proteins to regulate dendritic spine formation, cell survival, synaptic plasticity, neuronal excitability, and other processes. Either overexpression or loss of KCC2 can lead to abnormal circuit formation, seizures, or even perinatal death. GABA has been reported to be especially important for driving migration and development of cortical interneurons (IN), and we hypothesized that properly timed onset of KCC2 expression is vital to this process. To test this hypothesis, we created a mouse with conditional knockout of KCC2 in Dlx5-lineage neurons (Dlx5 KCC2 cKO), which targets INs and other post-mitotic GABAergic neurons in the forebrain starting during embryonic development. While KCC2 was first expressed in the INs of layer 5 cortex, perinatal IN migrations and laminar localization appeared to be unaffected by the loss of KCC2. Nonetheless, the mice had early seizures, failure to thrive, and premature death in the second and third weeks of life. At this age, we found an underlying change in IN distribution, including an excess number of somatostatin neurons in layer 5 and a decrease in parvalbumin-expressing neurons in layer 2/3 and layer 6. Our research suggests that while KCC2 expression may not be entirely necessary for early IN migration, loss of KCC2 causes an imbalance in cortical interneuron subtypes, seizures, and early death. More work will be needed to define the specific cellular basis for these findings, including whether they are due to abnormal circuit formation versus the sequela of defective IN inhibition.',\n",

We recently discovered that the A-class excitatory motor neurons (MNs) (A-MNs) function as intrinsic oscillators. They drive backward locomotion by generating rhythmic postsynaptic currents (rPSCs) in body wall muscles. Molecular underpinning of the rPSCs, however, is not fully elucidated. We report here that there are three types of the rPSC patterns, namely the phasic, tonic, and long-lasting, each with distinct kinetics and channel-dependence. The Na leak channel is required for all rPSC patterns. The tonic rPSCs exhibit strong dependence on the high-voltage-gated Ca channels. Three K channels, the BK-type Ca-activated K channel, Na-activated K channel, and voltage-gated K channel (Kv4), primarily inhibit tonic and long-lasting rPSCs with varying degrees and preferences. The elaborate regulation of rPSCs by different channels, through increasing or decreasing the rPSCs frequency and/or charge, correlates with the changes in the reversal velocity for respective channel mutants. The molecular dissection of different A-MNs-rPSC components therefore reveals different mechanisms for multiplex motor rhythm.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The major cause of disability in schizophrenia is cognitive impairment, which remains largely refractory to existing treatments. This reflects the fact that antipsychotics and other therapies have not been designed to address specific brain abnormalities that cause cognitive impairment. This overview proposes that understanding how specific cellular and synaptic loci within cortical microcircuits contribute to cortical gamma oscillations may reveal treatments for cognitive impairment. Gamma oscillations are rhythmic patterns of high frequency (∼30-100 Hz) neuronal activity that are synchronized within and across brain regions, generated by a class of inhibitory interneurons that express parvalbumin, and recruited during a variety of cognitive tasks. In schizophrenia, both parvalbumin interneuron function and task-evoked gamma oscillations are deficient. While it has long been controversial whether gamma oscillations are merely a biomarker of circuit function or actually contribute to information processing by neuronal networks, recent neurobiological studies in mice have shown that disrupting or enhancing synchronized gamma oscillations can reproduce or ameliorate cognitive deficits resembling those seen in schizophrenia. In fact, transiently enhancing the synchrony of parvalbumin interneuron-generated gamma oscillations can lead to long-lasting improvements in cognition in mice that model aspects of schizophrenia. Gamma oscillations emerge from specific patterns of connections between a variety of cell types within cortical microcircuits. Thus, a critical next step is to understand how specific cell types and synapses generate gamma oscillations, mediate the effects of gamma oscillations on information processing, and/or undergo plasticity following the induction of gamma oscillations. Modulating these circuit loci, potentially in combination with other approaches such as cognitive training and brain stimulation, may yield potent and selective interventions for enhancing cognition in schizophrenia.',\n",

While the technologies for neuronal reconstruction of EM images are under rapid progress, the technologies for synapse detection are lagging behind. Here, we propose a method that automatically detects the synapses in the 3D EM images, specifically for the mouse cerebellar molecular layer (CML). The method aims to accurately detect the synapses between the reconstructed neuronal fragments whose types can be identified. It extracts the contacts between the reconstructed neuronal fragments and classifies them as synaptic or non-synaptic with the help of type information and two deep learning artificial intelligences (AIs). The method can also assign the pre- and postsynaptic sides of a synapse and determine excitatory and inhibitory synapse types. The accuracy of this method is estimated to be 0.955 in F1-score for a test volume of CML containing 508 synapses. To demonstrate the usability, we measured the size and number of the synapses in the volume and investigated the subcellular connectivity between the CML neuronal fragments. The basic idea of the method to exploit tissue-specific properties can be extended to other brain regions.',\n",

However, it is unknown how cortical circuits avoid the converse problem: producing spurious sequences that are not reflecting sequences in their inputs. We develop methods to quantify and study sequentiality in neural responses. We show that recurrent circuit responses generally include spurious sequences, which are specifically prevented in circuits that obey two widely known features of cortical microcircuit organization: Dale's law and Hebbian connectivity. In particular, spike-timing-dependent plasticity in excitation-inhibition networks leads to an adaptive erasure of spurious sequences. We tested our theory in multielectrode recordings from the visual cortex of awake ferrets. Although responses to natural stimuli were largely non-sequential, responses to artificial stimuli initially included spurious sequences, which diminished over extended exposure.

Further, to investigate the impact of our therapeutic strategy on neuronal plasticity we perform long-term potentiation recordings and high-resolution electron microscopy. We show that central amygdala-targeted delivery of TIMP-1 designer nanoparticles reverses impaired cognition in Fmr1 knockouts, while having no impact on deficits of social behavior, hence corroborating symptom-specificity of the proposed approach. Moreover, we elucidate the neural correlates of the highly specific behavioral rescue by showing that the applied therapeutic intervention restores functional synaptic plasticity and ultrastructure of neurons in the central amygdala.

One promising noninvasive therapeutic tool that could harness plasticity in a spared descending respiratory circuit is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Here, we tested the effect of chronic high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS above the cortical areas in C2 hemisected rats when applied for 7 days, 1 month, or 2 months. An increase in intact hemidiaphragm electromyogram (EMG) activity and excitability (diaphragm motor evoked potentials) was observed after 1 month of rTMS application. Interestingly, despite no real functional effects of rTMS treatment on the injured hemidiaphragm activity during eupnea, 2 months of rTMS treatment strengthened the existing crossed phrenic pathways, allowing the injured hemidiaphragm to increase its activity during the respiratory challenge (i.e., asphyxia). This effect could be explained by a strengthening of respiratory descending fibers in the ventrolateral funiculi (an increase in GAP-43 positive fibers), sustained by a reduction in inflammation in the C1-C3 spinal cord (reduction in CD68 and Iba1 labeling), and acceleration of intracellular plasticity processes in phrenic motoneurons after chronic rTMS treatment. These results suggest that chronic high-frequency rTMS can ameliorate respiratory dysfunction and elicit neuronal plasticity with a reduction in deleterious post-traumatic inflammatory processes in the cervical spinal cord post-SCI. Thus, this therapeutic tool could be adopted and/or combined with other therapeutic interventions in order to further enhance beneficial outcomes.',\n",

Integrins are cell adhesion factors that link the extracellular matrix with intracellular actin cytoskeleton. We find that β1-integrin presence in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) during adolescence, but not adulthood, is necessary for mice to select actions based on reward likelihood and value. As such, adult mice that lacked β1-integrin during adolescence failed to modify response strategies when rewards lost value or failed to be delivered. This pattern suggests that β1-integrin-mediated neuronal development is necessary for PL function in adulthood. We next visualized adolescent PL neurons, including those receiving input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) - thought to signal salience - and projecting to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) - the striatal output by which the PL controls goal-seeking behavior. Firstly, we found that these projection-defined neurons had a distinct morphology relative to general layer V PL neurons. Secondly, β1-integrin loss triggered the overexpression of stubby-type dendritic spines at the expense of mature spines, including on projection-defined neurons. This phenotype was not observed when β1-integrins were silenced before or after adolescence. Altogether, our experiments localize β1-integrin-mediated cell adhesion within a developing di-synaptic circuit coordinating adaptive action.',\n",

We describe here the overall regulatory logic of enteric nervous system differentiation of the nematode  that resides within the foregut (pharynx) of the worm. A  homolog of the  Sine oculis homeobox gene, , is expressed in all 14 classes of interconnected pharyngeal neurons from their birth throughout their life time, but in no other neuron type of the entire animal. Constitutive and temporally controlled  removal shows that  is required to initiate and maintain the neuron type-specific terminal differentiation program of all pharyngeal neuron classes, including their circuit assembly. Through additional genetic loss of function analysis, we show that within each pharyngeal neuron class,  cooperates with different homeodomain transcription factors to individuate distinct pharyngeal neuron classes. Our analysis underscores the critical role of homeobox genes in neuronal identity specification and links them to the control of neuronal circuit assembly of the enteric nervous system. Together with the pharyngeal nervous system simplicity as well as its specification by a Sine oculis homolog, our findings invite speculations about the early evolution of nervous systems.',\n",

However, how neurons intrinsically monitor and feedback control presynaptic neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling to restrict neuronal network activity remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we investigated the reciprocal interplay between neuronal endosomes, organelles of central importance for the function of synapses, and synaptic activity. We show that elevated neuronal activity represses the synthesis of endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] by the lipid kinase VPS34. Neuronal activity in turn is regulated by endosomal PI(3)P, the depletion of which reduces neurotransmission as a consequence of perturbed SV endocytosis. We find that this mechanism involves Calpain 2-mediated hyperactivation of Cdk5 downstream of receptor- and activity-dependent calcium influx. Our results unravel an unexpected function for PI(3)P-containing neuronal endosomes in the control of presynaptic vesicle cycling and neurotransmission, which may explain the involvement of the PI(3)P-producing VPS34 kinase in neurological disease and neurodegeneration.',\n",

Loss-of-function mutations and duplications of FOXG1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans illustrating the importance of FOXG1 dosage for brain development. Aberrant FOXG1 dosage has been found to disrupt the balanced activity of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We report that FOXG1 is expressed in the main adult neurogenic niches in mice, i.e. the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subependymal zone/olfactory bulb system, where neurogenesis of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons persists into adulthood. These niches displayed differential vulnerability to increased FOXG1 dosage: high FOXG1 levels severely compromised survival and glutamatergic dentate granule neuron fate acquisition in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, but left neurogenesis of GABAergic neurons in the subependymal zone/olfactory bulb system unaffected. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed a significantly higher expression of the apoptosis-linked nuclear receptor Nr4a1 in FOXG1-overexpressing hippocampal neural precursors. Strikingly, pharmacological interference with NR4A1 function rescued FOXG1-dependent death of hippocampal progenitors. Our results reveal differential vulnerability of neuronal subtypes to increased FOXG1 dosage and suggest that activity of a FOXG1/NR4A1 axis contributes to such subtype-specific response.',\n",

Lamina I neurons are central to this mechanism, as they relay convergent nociceptive input to supraspinal pain centers. Unfortunately, little is known about the interactions between trigeminal and cervical afferents supplying Lamina I neurons. Here, we used rats of both sexes to show that cervical and trigeminal afferents interact via presynaptic inhibition, where monosynaptic inputs to Lamina I neurons undergo unidirectional as well as reciprocal presynaptic control. This means that afferent-driven presynaptic inhibition shapes the way trigeminal and cervical Aδ-fiber and C-fiber input reaches Lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and local-circuit neurons (LCNs). We propose that this inhibition provides a feedforward control of excitatory drive to Lamina I neurons that regulates their convergent and cervical-specific or trigeminal-specific processing modes. As a consequence, disruption of the trigeminal and cervical afferent-driven presynaptic inhibition may contribute to development of primary headache syndromes.

       "  'abstract': 'Chemical and electrical synapses (gap junctions) are widely prevalent in the nervous system. Gap junctions emerge long before chemical synapses, allowing communication between developing cells, and are thought to be involved in establishing neural circuits. Mounting evidence indicates that these two modalities of synaptic transmission closely interact during retinal development and that such interactions play a critical role in synaptogenesis and circuit formation during the perinatal period. In vertebrates, gap junctions consist of two connexins which in turn are made up of six connexins (Cx). To what extent Cx45 and Cx36, the most abundant connexins in the retina, are involved in synaptogenesis and retinal circuit formation is not known. The here presented immunohistochemical study used stainings of Cx45, Cx36 and Synaptophysin in the outer and inner (IPL) plexiform layers of postnatal day 8-16 mice retinas to shed light on the role of connexins during critical neuronal developmental processes. Cx45 and Cx36 expressions in both plexiform layers of the mouse retina increased till eye opening and dropped afterwards. The percentage of heterotypic Cx45/Cx36 gap junctions is also higher before the critical event of eye opening. Finally, Cx45 is closely located and/or colocalized with Synaptophysin also shortly before eye opening in the IPL of the mouse retina. All findings point towards a pivotal role for Cx45 during postnatal synaptogenesis in the mouse retina. However, a more functional study is needed to determine the role of Cx45 during synaptogenesis and circuit formation.',\n",

In TRAP2 mice, which allow activity-dependent genetic labeling, chemogenetic activation of the CLA neuronal ensemble tagged by acute social defeat stress (DS) elicited anxiety-related behaviors, whereas silencing of the CLA ensemble attenuated DS-induced anxiety-related behaviors. Moreover, the CLA received strong input from DS-activated basolateral amygdala neurons, and its circuit-selective optogenetic photostimulation temporarily elicited anxiety-related behaviors.

The mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear, though. One possible mechanism could consist in aberrant predictive processing, as schizophrenic patients show relatively less attenuated neuronal activity to self-produced tones, than healthy controls. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this aberrant predictive mechanism would manifest itself in the temporal irregularity of neuronal signals. For that purpose, we here introduce an event-related potential (ERP) study model analysis that consists of an EEG real-time model equation, eeg(t) and a frequency Laplace transformed Transfer Function (TF) equation, eeg(s). Combining circuit analysis with control and cable theory, we estimate the temporal model representations of auditory ERPs to reveal neural mechanisms that make predictions about self-generated sensations. We use data from 49 schizophrenic patients (SZ) and 32 healthy control (HC) subjects in an auditory 'prediction' paradigm; i.e., who either pressed a button to deliver a sound tone (epoch a), or just heard the tone without button press (epoch b). Our results show significantly higher degrees of temporal irregularity or imprecision between different trials of the ERP from the Cz electrode (N100, P200) in SZ compared to HC (Levene's test, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) as indexed by altered latency, lower similarity/correlation of single trial time courses (using dynamic time warping), and longer settling times to reach steady state in the intertrial interval. Using machine learning, SZ vs HC could be highly accurately classified (92%) based on the temporal parameters of their ERPs' TF models, using as features the poles of the TF rational functions. Together, our findings show temporal irregularity or imprecision between single trials to be abnormally increased in SZ. This may indicate a general impairment of SZ, related to precisely predicting the sensory consequences of one's actions.\",\n",

Critical roles for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling are well established in the  mushroom body (MB) learning and memory circuitry, but local PKA activity within this well-mapped neuronal network is uncharacterized. Here, we use an  PKA activity sensor (PKA-SPARK) to test spatiotemporal regulatory requirements in the MB axon lobes. We find immature animals have little detectable PKA activity, whereas postcritical period adults show high field-selective activation primarily in just 3/16 defined output regions. In addition to the age-dependent PKA activity in distinct α'/β' lobe nodes, females show sex-dependent elevation compared with males in these same restricted regions. Loss of neural cell body Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Rugose [human Neurobeachin (NBEA)] suppresses localized PKA activity, whereas overexpression (OE) of MB lobe PKA-synergist Meng-Po (human SBK1) promotes PKA activity. Elevated Meng-Po subverts the PKA age-dependence, with elevated activity in immature animals, and spatial-restriction, with striking γ lobe activity. Testing circuit signaling requirements with temperature-sensitive  (human Dynamin) blockade, we find broadly expanded PKA activity within the MB lobes. Using transgenic tetanus toxin to block MB synaptic output, we find greatly heightened PKA activity in virtually all MB lobe fields, although the age-dependence is maintained. We conclude spatiotemporally restricted PKA activity signaling within this well-mapped learning/memory circuit is age-dependent and sex-dependent, driven by FMRP-Rugose pathway activation, temporally promoted by Meng-Po kinase function, and restricted by output neurotransmission providing network feedback.\",\n",

These observations were different from the immediate antihyperalgesic effects of EA. c-Fos/orexin double labeling revealed that EA stimulation on 14 days but not on 28 days after SNI modeling activated greater numbers of c-Fos positive orexin neurons in the LH after the CPP test. Moreover, the administration of an orexin-A antagonist in the LH significantly blocked the reward effects of pain relief induced by EA. Furthermore, by using cholera toxin b subunit combined with c-Fos detection, we found that the orexin circuit from the LH to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell was significantly activated after EA induced CPP. Microinjection of the orexin antagonist into the NAc shell substantially attenuated the CPP induced by EA. Intravenous injection of low-dose orexin-A together with EA resulted in significantly greater antihyperalgesia effects and CPP scores. Together, these findings clearly demonstrated that LH orexin signaling could potentially play a critical role in the reward effects of pain relief induced by acupuncture. The observations of the present study extended our understanding of orexin signaling in the LH and its role in EA-induced reward, providing new insights into the mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia.',\n",

Intracellular calcium release (ICR) from the endoplasmic reticulum has long been thought to shape these mechanisms. However, ICR has not been investigated in mammalian neurons in vivo. We combined electroporation of single CA1 pyramidal neurons, simultaneous imaging of dendritic and somatic activity during spatial navigation, optogenetic place field induction, and acute genetic augmentation of ICR cytosolic impact to reveal that ICR supports the establishment of dendritic feature selectivity and shapes integrative properties determining output-level receptive fields. This role for ICR was more prominent in apical than in basal dendrites.

Although HD cells have been shown to act as an internal neuronal compass in various cortical and subcortical regions, the neural substrate of HD cells is incompletely understood. It is reported that HD cells in the somatosensory cortex comprise regular-spiking (RS, putative excitatory) and fast-spiking (FS, putative inhibitory) neurons. Surprisingly, somatosensory FS HD cells fire in bursts and display much sharper head-directionality than RS HD cells. These FS HD cells are nonconjunctive, rarely theta rhythmic, sparsely connected and enriched in layer 5. Moreover, sharply tuned FS HD cells, in contrast with RS HD cells, maintain stable tuning in darkness; FS HD cells' coexistence with RS HD cells and angular head velocity (AHV) cells in a layer-specific fashion through the somatosensory cortex presents a previously unreported configuration of spatial representation in the neocortex. Together, these findings challenge the notion that FS interneurons are weakly tuned to sensory stimuli, and offer a local circuit organization relevant to the generation and transmission of HD signaling in the brain.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The superior colliculus (SC) integrates visual and other sensory information to regulate critical reflexive and innate behaviors, such as prey capture. In the mouse, the vast majority of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervate the SC, including inputs from both the contralateral (contra-RGCs) and ipsilateral (ipsi-RGCs) eye. Despite this, previous studies revealed minimal neuronal responses to ipsilateral stimulation and few binocular interactions in the mouse SC. More recent work suggests that ipsi-RGC function and innervation of the SC are critical for efficient prey capture, raising the possibility that binocular interactions in the mouse SC may be more prevalent than previously thought. To explore this possibility, we investigated eye-specific and binocular influences on visual responses and tuning of SC neurons, focusing on the anteromedial region. Although the majority of SC neurons were primarily driven by contralateral eye stimulation, we observed that a substantial proportion of units were influenced or driven by ipsilateral stimulation. Clustering based on differential responses to eye-specific stimulus presentation revealed five distinct putative subpopulations and multiple modes of binocular interaction, including facilitation, summation, and suppression. Each of the putative subpopulations exhibited selectivity for orientation, and differences in spatial frequency tuning and spatial summation properties were observed between subpopulations. Further analysis of orientation tuning under different ocular conditions supported differential modes of binocular interaction between putative subtypes. Taken together, these data suggest that binocular interactions in the mouse SC may be more prevalent and diverse than previously understood. The mouse superior colliculus (SC) receives binocular inputs, which inform complex behavioral programs. However, we know surprisingly little about binocular tuning in the rodent SC. Here, we characterize responses to eye-specific presentations of visual stimuli and reveal a previously unappreciated diversity of binocularly modulated neurons in the SC. This foundational work broadens our understanding of visual processing in the SC and sets the stage for future studies interrogating the circuit mechanisms underlying binocular tuning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We previously linked TSHZ3 haploinsufficiency to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and showed that embryonic or postnatal Tshz3 deletion in mice results in behavioral traits relevant to the two core domains of ASD, namely social interaction deficits and repetitive behaviors. Here, we provide evidence that cortical projection neurons (CPNs) and striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) are two main and complementary players in the TSHZ3-linked ASD syndrome. In the cerebral cortex, TSHZ3 is expressed in CPNs and in a proportion of GABAergic interneurons, but not in cholinergic interneurons or glial cells. In the striatum, TSHZ3 is expressed in all SCINs, while its expression is absent or partial in the other main brain cholinergic systems. We then characterized two new conditional knockout (cKO) models generated by crossing Tshz3 with Emx1-Cre (Emx1-cKO) or Chat-Cre (Chat-cKO) mice to decipher the respective role of CPNs and SCINs. Emx1-cKO mice show altered excitatory synaptic transmission onto CPNs and impaired plasticity at corticostriatal synapses, with neither cortical neuron loss nor abnormal layer distribution. These animals present social interaction deficits but no repetitive patterns of behavior. Chat-cKO mice exhibit no loss of SCINs but changes in the electrophysiological properties of these interneurons, associated with repetitive patterns of behavior without social interaction deficits. Therefore, dysfunction in either CPNs or SCINs segregates with a distinct ASD behavioral trait. These findings provide novel insights onto the implication of the corticostriatal circuitry in ASD by revealing an unexpected neuronal dichotomy in the biological background of the two core behavioral domains of this disorder.',\n",

Axonal compartmentalization may enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter neuronal output in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. Here, we show that olfactory learning generates compartmentalized, bidirectional plasticity of acetylcholine release that varies across the longitudinal compartments of  mushroom body (MB) axons. The directionality of the learning-induced plasticity depends on the valence of the learning event (aversive vs. appetitive), varies linearly across proximal to distal compartments following appetitive conditioning, and correlates with learning-induced changes in downstream mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that modulate behavioral action selection. Potentiation of acetylcholine release was dependent on the Ca2.1 calcium channel subunit . In addition, contrast between the positive conditioned stimulus and other odors required the inositol triphosphate receptor, which maintained responsivity to odors upon repeated presentations, preventing adaptation. Downstream from the MB, a set of MBONs that receive their input from the γ3 MB compartment were required for normal appetitive learning, suggesting that they represent a key node through which reward learning influences decision-making. These data demonstrate that learning drives valence-correlated, compartmentalized, bidirectional potentiation, and depression of synaptic neurotransmitter release, which rely on distinct mechanisms and are distributed across axonal compartments in a learning circuit.',\n",

Here, we investigated in male rats how sub-regions of the hippocampus are involved in memory representation in behavioral tagging and how early aging affects such representation by combining behavioral training in appetitive delayed-matching-to-place tasks with the \"cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence  hybridization\" technique. We show that neuronal assemblies activated by memory encoding were also partially activated by novelty, particularly in the distal CA1 and proximal CA3 subregions in young male rats. In early aging, both encoding- and novelty-triggered neuronal populations were significantly reduced with a more profound effect in encoding neurons. Thus, memory persistence through novelty facilitation engages overlapping hippocampal assemblies as a key cellular signature, and cognitive aging is associated with underlying reduction in neuronal activation.',\n",

One day after the last stimulation session, optokinetic responses were assessed and fluorescent tracers were injected to map corticotectal and geniculocortical projections. We found that LI-rTMS in either treatment condition refined the geniculocortical map. Corticotectal projections were improved in locomotion+LI-rTMS subjects, but not in dark + LI-rTMS and sham groups. Visuomotor behaviour was not improved in any condition. Our results suggest that the beneficial reorganisation of abnormal visual circuits by rTMS can be significantly influenced by simultaneous, ambient visual input and is enhanced by concomitant physical exercise. Furthermore, the observed pathway-specific effects suggest that regional molecular changes and/or the relative proximity of terminals to the induced electric fields influence the outcomes of LI-rTMS on abnormal circuitry.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Axon branching is a fundamental aspect of neuronal morphogenesis, neuronal circuit formation, and response of the nervous system to injury. Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) was initially identified as promoting Wallerian degeneration of axons. We now report a novel function of SARM1 in postnatal sensory neurons; the suppression of axon branching. Axon collateral branches develop from axonal filopodia precursors through the coordination of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton.  analysis revealed that cultured P0-2 dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons from a SARM1 knockout (KO) mouse exhibit increased numbers of collateral branches and axonal filopodia relative to wild-type neurons. In SARM1 KO mice, cutaneous sensory endings exhibit increased branching in the skin  with normal density of innervation. Transient axonal actin patches serve as cytoskeletal platforms from which axonal filopodia emerge. Live imaging analysis of axonal actin dynamics showed that SARM1 KO neurons exhibit increased rates of axonal actin patch formation and increased probability that individual patches will give rise to a filopodium before dissipating. SARM1 KO axons contain elevated levels of drebrin and cortactin, two actin regulatory proteins that are positive regulators of actin patches, filopodia formation, and branching. Live imaging of microtubule plus tip dynamics revealed an increase in the rate of formation and velocity of polymerizing tips along the axons of SARM1 KO neurons. Stationary mitochondria define sites along the axon where branches may arise, and the axons of SARM1 KO sensory neurons exhibit an increase in stationary mitochondria. These data reveal SARM1 to be a negative regulator of axonal cytoskeletal dynamics and collateral branching.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition featured by motor dysfunction, death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates. Growing evidence suggests that PD diagnosis happens late in the disease progression and that the pathology may originate much earlier in the enteric nervous system (ENS) before advancing to the brain, via autonomic fibers. It was recently described that a specific cell type from the gut epithelium named enteroendocrine cells (EECs) possess many neuron-like properties including αSyn expression. By facing the gut lumen and being directly connected with αSyn-containing enteric neurons in a synaptic manner, EECs form a neural circuit between the gastrointestinal tract and the ENS, thereby being a possible key player in the outcome of PD in the gut. We have characterized the progression and the cellular mechanisms involved in αSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) transfer from EECs to neuronal cells. We show that brain organoids efficiently internalize αSyn PFF seeds which triggers the formation of larger intracellular inclusions. In addition, in the enteroendocrine cell line STC-1 and in the neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y, αSyn PFFs induced intracellular calcium (Ca) oscillations on an extracellular Ca source-dependent manner and triggered αSyn fibrils internalization by endocytosis. We characterized the spread of αSyn PFFs from enteroendocrine to neuronal cells and showed that this process is dependent on physical cell-to-cell contact and on Rab35 GTPase. Lastly, inhibition of Rab35 increases the clearance of αSyn fibrils by redirecting them to the lysosomal compartment. Therefore, our results reveal mechanisms that contribute to the understanding of how seeded αSyn fibrils promote the progression of αSyn pathology from EECs to neuronal cells shifting the focus of PD etiology to the ENS.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent spinal cord literature abounds with descriptions of genetic preprogramming and the molecular control of circuit formation. In this paper, we explore to what extent circuit formation based on learning rather than preprogramming could explain the selective formation of the monosynaptic projections between muscle spindle primary afferents and homonymous motoneurons. We adjusted the initially randomized gains in the neural network according to a Hebbian plasticity rule while exercising the model system with spontaneous muscle activity patterns similar to those observed during early fetal development. Normal connectivity patterns developed only when we modeled β motoneurons, which are known to innervate both intrafusal and extrafusal muscle fibers in vertebrate muscles but were not considered in previous literature regarding selective formation of these synapses in animals with paralyzed muscles. It was also helpful to correctly model the greatly reduced contractility of extrafusal muscle fibers during early development. Stronger and more coordinated muscle activity patterns such as observed later during neonatal locomotion impaired projection selectivity. These findings imply a generic functionality of a musculoskeletal system to imprint important aspects of its mechanical dynamics onto a neural network, without specific preprogramming other than setting a critical period for the formation and maturation of this general pattern of connectivity. Such functionality would facilitate the successful evolution of new species with altered musculoskeletal anatomy, and it may help to explain patterns of connectivity and associated reflexes that appear during abnormal development. A novel model of self-organization of early spinal circuitry based on a biologically realistic plant, sensors, and neuronal plasticity in conjunction with empirical observations of fetal development. Without explicit need for guiding genetic rules, connection matrices emerge that support functional self-organization of the mature pattern of Ia to motoneuron connectivity in the spinal circuitry.',\n",

To circumvent developmental perturbations and to test whether astrocytic gap junction coupling is required for hippocampal neural circuit function and behavior, we generate and study inducible, astrocyte-specific Cx30 and Cx43 double knockouts.

Here, we explored whether and how the cholinergic system regulates inhibitory axonal ramification of neocortical chandelier cells (ChCs), which control spike generation by innervating axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons. We found that acetylcholine (ACh) signaling through nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) and downstream T-type voltage-dependent calcium (Ca) channels cell-autonomously controls axonal arborization in developing ChCs through regulating filopodia initiation. This signaling axis shapes the basal Ca level range in varicosities where filopodia originate. Furthermore, the normal development of ChC axonal arbors requires proper levels of activity in subcortical cholinergic neurons. Thus, the cholinergic system regulates inhibitory network arborization in the developing neocortex and may tune cortical circuit properties depending on early-life experiences.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) such as stroke, brain, and spinal cord trauma often result in permanent disabilities because adult CNS neurons only exhibit limited axon regeneration. The brain has a surprising intrinsic capability of recovering itself after injury. However, the hostile extrinsic microenvironment significantly hinders axon regeneration. Recent advances have indicated that the inactivation of intrinsic regenerative pathways plays a pivotal role in the failure of most adult CNS neuronal regeneration. Particularly, substantial evidence has convincingly demonstrated that the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is one of the most crucial intrinsic regenerative pathways that drive axonal regeneration and sprouting in various CNS injuries. In this review, we will discuss the recent findings and highlight the critical roles of mTOR pathway in axon regeneration in different types of CNS injury. Importantly, we will demonstrate that the reactivation of this regenerative pathway can be achieved by blocking the key mTOR signaling components such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Given that multiple mTOR signaling components are endogenous inhibitory factors of this pathway, we will discuss the promising potential of RNA-based therapeutics which are particularly suitable for this purpose, and the fact that they have attracted substantial attention recently after the success of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. To specifically tackle the blood-brain barrier issue, we will review the current technology to deliver these RNA therapeutics into the brain with a focus on nanoparticle technology. We will propose the clinical application of these RNA-mediated therapies in combination with the brain-targeted drug delivery approach against mTOR signaling components as an effective and feasible therapeutic strategy aiming to enhance axonal regeneration for functional recovery after CNS injury.',\n",

However, regeneration of spinal-specific neurons and circuit re-assembly remain challenging in the dysregulated milieu of SCI because of impaired neurogenesis and neuronal maturation by neural precursor cells (NPCs) spontaneously or in cell-based strategies. The extrinsic mechanisms that regulate neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis in SCI are poorly understood. Here, we perform extensive  and  studies to unravel that SCI-induced upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) impedes neurogenesis of NPCs through co-activation of two receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases, LAR and PTPσ. In adult female rats with SCI, systemic co-inhibition of LAR and PTPσ promotes regeneration of motoneurons and spinal interneurons by engrafted human directly reprogramed caudalized NPCs (drNPC-O2) and fosters their morphologic maturity and synaptic connectivity within the host neural network that culminate in improved recovery of locomotion and sensorimotor integration. Our transcriptomic analysis of engrafted human NPCs in the injured spinal cord confirmed that inhibition of CSPG receptors activates a comprehensive program of gene expression in NPCs that can support neuronal differentiation, maturation, morphologic complexity, signal transmission, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral improvement after SCI. We uncovered that CSPG/LAR/PTPσ axis suppresses neuronal differentiation in part by blocking Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that CSPGs/LAR/PTPσ axis restricts neurogenesis and synaptic integration of new neurons in NPC cellular therapies for SCI. We propose targeting LAR and PTPσ receptors offers a promising clinically-feasible adjunct treatment to optimize the efficacy and neurologic benefits of ongoing NPC-based clinical trials for SCI. Transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) is a promising approach for replacing damaged neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, survival, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic connectivity of transplanted NPCs within remain challenging in SCI. Here, we unravel that activation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)/LAR/PTPσ axis after SCI impedes the capacity of transplanted human NPCs for replacing functionally integrated neurons. Co-blockade of LAR and PTPσ is sufficient to promote re-generation of motoneurons and spinal V1 and V3 interneurons by engrafted human caudalized directly reprogramed NPCs (drNPC-O2) and facilitate their synaptic integration within the injured spinal cord. CSPG/LAR/PTPσ axis appears to suppress neuronal differentiation of NPCs by inhibiting Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. These findings identify targeting CSPG/LAR/PTPσ axis as a promising strategy for optimizing neuronal replacement, synaptic re-connectivity, and neurologic recovery in NPC-based strategies.',\n",

However,  studies tend to use cells of animal origin rather than human neurons, leading to conclusions that might not be generalizable to humans and limiting the possibilities for relevant studies on neurological disorders. Here we present a method to build arrays of topologically controlled circuits of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. The circuits consist of 4 to 50 neurons with well-defined connections, confined by microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes. Such circuits were characterized using optical imaging and microelectrode arrays (MEAs), suggesting the formation of functional connections between the neurons of a circuit. Electrophysiology recordings were performed on circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons for at least 4.5 months. We believe that the capacity to build small and controlled circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons holds great promise to better understand the fundamental principles of information processing and storing in the brain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Synchronization of neural oscillations is thought to facilitate communication in the brain. Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson\\'s disease (PD) can result in synaptic reorganization of the motor circuit, leading to altered neuronal dynamics and impaired neural communication. Treatments for PD aim to restore network function via pharmacological means such as dopamine replacement, or by suppressing pathological oscillations with deep brain stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that brain stimulation can operate beyond a simple \"reversible lesion\" effect to augment network communication. Specifically, we examined the modulation of beta band (14-30 Hz) activity, a known biomarker of motor deficits and potential control signal for stimulation in Parkinson\\'s. To do this we setup a neural mass model of population activity within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuit with parameters that were constrained to yield spectral features comparable to those in experimental Parkinsonism. We modulated the connectivity of two major pathways known to be disrupted in PD and constructed statistical summaries of the spectra and functional connectivity of the resulting spontaneous activity. These were then used to assess the network-wide outcomes of closed-loop stimulation delivered to motor cortex and phase locked to subthalamic beta activity. Our results demonstrate that the spatial pattern of beta synchrony is dependent upon the strength of inputs to the STN. Precisely timed stimulation has the capacity to recover network states, with stimulation phase inducing activity with distinct spectral and spatial properties. These results provide a theoretical basis for the design of the next-generation brain stimulators that aim to restore neural communication in disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Feedforward and feedback pathways interact in specific dendritic domains to enable cognitive functions such as predictive processing and learning. Based on axonal projections, hierarchically lower areas are thought to form synapses primarily on dendrites in middle cortical layers, whereas higher-order areas are thought to target dendrites in layer 1 and in deep layers. However, the extent to which functional synapses form in regions of axodendritic overlap has not been extensively studied. Here, we use viral tracing in the secondary visual cortex of male mice to map brain-wide inputs to thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive map of input locations through subcellular optogenetic circuit mapping. We show that input pathways target distinct dendritic domains with far greater specificity than appears from their axonal branching, often deviating substantially from the canonical patterns. Common assumptions regarding the dendrite-level interaction of feedforward and feedback inputs may thus need revisiting. Perception and learning depend on the ability of the brain to shape neuronal representations across all processing stages. Long-range connections across different hierarchical levels enable diverse sources of contextual information, such as predictions or motivational state, to modify feedforward signals. Assumptions regarding the organization of this hierarchical connectivity have not been extensively verified. Here, we assess the synaptic connectivity of brain-wide projections onto pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex of mice. Using trans-synaptic viral tracing and subcellular optogenetic circuit mapping, we show that functional synapses do not follow the consistent connectivity rule predicted by their axonal branching patterns. These findings highlight the diversity of computational strategies operating throughout cortical networks and may aid in building better artificial networks.',\n",

To understand how specific neuronal circuits are impaired in AD, we have used optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches to reveal the functional changes between prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basal forebrain (BF), 2 key regions controlling cognitive processes, in a tauopathy mouse model. We found that the glutamatergic synaptic responses in BF cholinergic neurons from P301S Tau mice (6-8\\xa0months old) were markedly diminished. The attenuated long-range PFC to BF pathway in the AD model significantly increased the failure rate of action potential firing of BF cholinergic neurons triggered by optogenetic stimulations of glutamatergic terminals from PFC. In contrast, the projection from PFC to other regions, such as amygdala and striatum, was largely unaltered. On the other hand, optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic terminals from BF induced a persistent reduction of the excitability of PFC pyramidal neurons from Tau mice, instead of the transient reduction exhibited in wild-type mice. Taken together, these data have revealed a selective aberration of the pathway between PFC pyramidal neurons and BF cholinergic neurons in a tauopathy mouse model.

       "  'abstract': 'During visually guided behaviors, mere hundreds of milliseconds can elapse between a sensory input and its associated behavioral response. How spikes occurring at different times are integrated to drive perception and action remains poorly understood. We delivered random trains of optogenetic stimulation (white noise) to excite inhibitory interneurons in V1 of mice of both sexes while they performed a visual detection task. We then performed a reverse correlation analysis on the optogenetic stimuli to generate a neuronal-behavioral kernel, an unbiased, temporally precise estimate of how suppression of V1 spiking at different moments around the onset of a visual stimulus affects detection of that stimulus. Electrophysiological recordings enabled us to capture the effects of optogenetic stimuli on V1 responsivity and revealed that the earliest stimulus-evoked spikes are preferentially weighted for guiding behavior. These data demonstrate that white noise optogenetic stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding how patterns of spiking in neuronal populations are decoded in generating perception and action. During visually guided actions, continuous chains of neurons connect our retinas to our motoneurons. To unravel circuit contributions to behavior, it is crucial to establish the relative functional position(s) that different neural structures occupy in processing and relaying the signals that support rapid, precise responses. To address this question, we randomly inhibited activity in mouse V1 throughout the stimulus-response cycle while the animals did many repetitions of a visual task. The period that led to impaired performance corresponded to the earliest stimulus-driven response in V1, with no effect of inhibition immediately before or during late stages of the stimulus-driven response. This approach offers experimenters a powerful method for uncovering the temporal weighting of spikes from stimulus to response.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Quantum dynamical systems are capable of powerful computation but are hard to emulate on digital computers. We show that four novel analog circuit parts can emulate the phase-coherent unitary dynamics of such systems. These four parts are: a Planck capacitance analogous to a neuronal membrane capacitance; a quantum admittance element, together with the Planck capacitance, analogous to a neuronal quadrature oscillator; a quantum transadmittance element analogous to a complex neuronal synapse; and a quantum transadmittance mixer element analogous to a complex neuronal synapse with resonant modulation. These parts may be emulated classically, with paired real-value voltages on paired Planck capacitances corresponding to the real and imaginary portions of a probability amplitude; and appropriate paired real-value currents onto these Planck capacitances corresponding to diagonal (admittance), off-diagonal (transadmittance), or controlled off-diagonal (transadmittance mixer) Hamiltonian energy terms. The superposition of 2n simultaneously phase-coherent and symmetric probability-voltage amplitudes with O(n) of these parts, in a tensor-product architecture enables analog emulation of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Implementation of our circuits on an analog integrated circuit in a 0.18 μm process yield experimental results consistent with mathematical theory and computer simulations for emulations of NMR, Josephson junction, and QFT dynamics. Our results suggest that linear oscillatory neuronal networks with pairs of complex subthreshold/nonspiking sine and cosine neurons that are coupled together via complex synapses to other such complex neurons can architect quantum-inspired computation with classical analog circuits. Thus, an analog-circuit mapping between quantum and neural computation, both of which exploit analog computation for powerful operation, can enable future synergies between these fields.',\n",

Circuit structure is genetically determined in vertebrates and invertebrates, but the mechanisms guiding each axon to precisely innervate a unique pre-specified target cell are poorly understood. We investigated Drosophila embryonic motoneurons using single-cell genomics, imaging, and genetics. We show that a cell-specific combination of homeodomain transcription factors and downstream immunoglobulin domain proteins is expressed in individual cells and plays an important role in determining cell-specific connections between differentiated motoneurons and target muscles. We provide genetic evidence for a functional role of five homeodomain transcription factors and four immunoglobulins in the neuromuscular wiring. Knockdown and ectopic expression of these homeodomain transcription factors induces cell-specific synaptic wiring defects that are partly phenocopied by genetic modulations of their immunoglobulin targets. Taken together, our data suggest that homeodomain transcription factor and immunoglobulin molecule expression could be directly linked and function as a crucial determinant of neuronal circuit structure.',\n",

Although glia have established roles in synapse development, the contribution of neuron-glia interactions to developmental activity remains largely unexplored. Here we show that astrocytes are necessary for developmental activity during synaptogenesis in Drosophila. Using wide-field epifluorescence and two-photon imaging, we show that the glia of the central nervous system participate in developmental activity with type-specific patterns of intracellular calcium dynamics. Genetic ablation of astrocytes, but not of cortex or ensheathing glia, leads to severe attenuation of neuronal activity. Similarly, inhibition of neuronal activity results in the loss of astrocyte calcium dynamics. By altering these dynamics, we show that astrocytic calcium cycles can influence neuronal activity but are not necessary per se. Taken together, our results indicate that, in addition to their recognized role in the structural maturation of synapses, astrocytes are also necessary for the function of synapses during development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It is generally appreciated that storing memories of specific events in the mammalian brain, and associating features of the environment with behavioral outcomes requires fine-tuning of the strengths of connections between neurons through synaptic plasticity. It is less understood whether the organization of neuronal circuits comprised of multiple distinct neuronal cell types provides an architectural prior that facilitates learning and memory by generating unique patterns of neuronal activity in response to different stimuli in the environment, even before plasticity and learning occur. Here we simulated a neuronal network responding to sensory stimuli, and systematically determined the effects of specific neuronal cell types and connections on three key metrics of neuronal sensory representations: sparsity, selectivity, and discriminability. We found that when the total amount of input varied considerably across stimuli, standard feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuit motifs failed to discriminate all stimuli without sacrificing sparsity or selectivity. Interestingly, networks that included dedicated excitatory feedback interneurons based on the mossy cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus exhibited improved pattern separation, a result that depended on the indirect recruitment of feedback inhibition. These results elucidate the roles of cellular diversity and neural circuit architecture on generating neuronal representations with properties advantageous for memory storage and recall.',\n",

Although most molecules involved in endocytosis have been identified, it remains rather poorly understood how endocytic machinery regulates vesicle size. Vesicle size, together with the transmitter concentration inside the vesicle, determines the amount of transmitter the vesicle can release, the quantal size, that may control the strength of synaptic transmission. Here, we report that, surprisingly, knockout of the GTPase dynamin 1, the most abundant brain dynamin isoform known to catalyze fission of the membrane pit's neck (the last step of endocytosis), not only significantly slowed endocytosis but also increased the synaptic vesicle diameter by as much as ∼40-64% at cultured hippocampal synapses. Furthermore, dynamin 1 knockout increased the size of membrane pits, the precursor for endocytic vesicle formation. These results suggest an important function of dynamin other than its well-known fission function - control of vesicle size at the pit formation stage.\",\n",

However, mechanisms must exist to tightly control responses to stressors, since overactivation of stress circuits is deleterious for the wellbeing of an organism. The underlying neuronal dynamics responsible for controlling behavioral responses to stress have remained unclear. Here, we describe a neuronal circuit in the hypothalamus of zebrafish larvae that inhibits stress-related behaviors and prevents excessive activation of the neuroendocrine pathway hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. Central components of this circuit are neurons secreting the neuropeptide Galanin, as ablation of these neurons led to abnormally high levels of stress. Surprisingly, we found that Galanin has a self-inhibitory action on Galanin-producing neurons.

Whether and how testosterone signaling during the perinatal period affects GABAergic transmission is unclear. Here, we analyzed GABAergic circuit functional markers in male, female, testosterone-treated female, and testosterone-insensitive male rats after the first postnatal week and in young adults. In the hippocampus, mRNA levels of proteins associated with GABA signaling were not significantly affected at postnatal day (P) 7 or P40. Conversely, membrane protein levels of KCC2, which are critical for determining inhibition strength, were significantly higher in females compared to males and testosterone-treated females at P7. Further, female and testosterone-insensitive male rats at P7 showed higher levels of the neurotrophin BDNF, which is a powerful regulator of neuronal function, including GABAergic transmission. Finally, spontaneous GABAergic currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were more frequent in females and testosterone-insensitive males at P40. Overall, these results show that perinatal testosterone levels modulate GABAergic circuit function, suggesting a critical role of perinatal sex hormones in regulating network excitability in the adult hippocampus.',\n",

There is a lack of described  models of spinal cord neurons in which to develop new regeneration treatments. For this reason, we developed a new model of mouse primary spinal cord neuronal culture in which to analyze maturation, morphology, physiology, connectivity and regeneration of identified interneurons. Isolated from E14 mice, the neurons mature over 15 days , demonstrated by expression of maturity markers, electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings, and formation of synapses. The neurons express markers of SpINs, including Tlx3, Lmx1b, Lbx1, Chx10, and Pax2. The neurons demonstrate distinct morphologies and some form perineuronal nets in long-term cultivation. Live neurons in various maturation stages were axotomized, using a 900 nm multiphoton laser and their fate was observed overnight.

In the present study, we find that the global  male mice exhibit anxious behaviors, whereas the Slack  male mice manifest anxiolytic behaviors. The expression of Slack channels is rich in basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic neurons and downregulated in chronic corticosterone-treated mice. In addition, electrophysiological data show enhanced excitability of BLA glutamatergic neurons in the  mice and decreased excitability of these neurons in the  mice. Furthermore, the Slack channel deletion in BLA glutamatergic neurons is sufficient to result in enhanced avoidance behaviors, whereas  gene expression in the BLA or BLA-ventral hippocampus (vHPC) glutamatergic projections reverses anxious behaviors of the  mice. Our study identifies the role of the Slack channel in controlling anxious behaviors by decreasing the excitability of BLA-vHPC glutamatergic projections, providing a potential target for anxiolytic therapies. Anxiety disorders are a series of mental disorders characterized by anxiety and fear, but the molecular basis of these disorders remains unclear. Here, we examined the behaviors of loss- and gain-of-function of Slack channel mice in elevated plus maze and open field tests and found the anxiolytic role of the Slack channel. By altering the Slack channel expression in the specific neuronal circuit, we demonstrated that the Slack channel played its anxiolytic role by decreasing the excitability of BLA-vHPC glutamatergic projections. Our data reveal the role of the Slack channel in the regulation of anxiety, which may provide a potential molecular target for anxiolytic therapies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mossy cells (MCs) of the dentate gyrus are key components of an excitatory associative circuit established by reciprocal connections with dentate granule cells (GCs). MCs are implicated in place field encoding, pattern separation, and novelty detection, as well as in brain disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy and depression. Despite their functional relevance, little is known about the determinants that control MC activity. Here, we examined whether MCs express functional kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors involved in neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and epilepsy. Using mouse hippocampal slices, we found that bath application of submicromolar and micromolar concentrations of the KAR agonist kainic acid induced inward currents and robust MC firing. These effects were abolished in GluK2 KO mice, indicating the presence of functional GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. In contrast to CA3 pyramidal cells, which are structurally and functionally similar to MCs and express synaptic KARs at mossy fiber (MF) inputs (i.e., GC axons), we found no evidence for KAR-mediated transmission at MF-MC synapses, indicating that most KARs at MCs are extrasynaptic. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy analyses confirmed the extrasynaptic localization of GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. Finally, blocking glutamate transporters, a manipulation that increases extracellular levels of endogenous glutamate, was sufficient to induce KAR-mediated inward currents in MCs, suggesting that MC-KARs can be activated by increases in ambient glutamate. Our findings provide the first direct evidence of functional extrasynaptic KARs at a critical excitatory neuron of the hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells (MCs) are an understudied population of hippocampal neurons that form an excitatory loop with dentate granule cells. MCs have been implicated in pattern separation, spatial navigation, and epilepsy. Despite their importance in hippocampal function and disease, little is known about how MC activity is recruited. Here, we show for the first time that MCs express extrasynaptic kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors critically involved in neuronal function and epilepsy. While we found no evidence for synaptic KARs in MCs, KAR activation induced strong action potential firing of MCs, raising the possibility that extracellular KARs regulate MC excitability  and may also promote dentate gyrus hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis.',\n",

The hypothesized substrate for these navigational abilities is the central complex (CX), a midline brain structure with orderly topology. The circuit transformations performed by the CX are now being concretely described by recent advances in the study of fruit fly neural circuits. An emerging theme is dynamic representation of navigational variables (e.g.\\xa0heading or travel direction) computed in a manner distributed across specific neuronal populations. These representations are shaped by multimodal inputs whose weights evolve rapidly as surroundings change. Investigation of CX circuits is revealing with precise detail how structured wiring and synaptic plasticity enable neural circuits to flexibly subsample from the currently available sensory and motor cues to build a stable and accurate map of space. Given the sensory richness of natural environments, these findings are encouraging insect neuroscientists to no longer ask which cues insects use to navigate, but instead which cues can insects use, and under which contexts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized among others by impairments in social interactions and repetitive behavior. According to one of the leading hypotheses about its origin, ASD is caused by the imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory circuit activity. ASD-related morphological and functional changes can be observed in several brain regions i.e., in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. It is well-established that prenatal valproic-acid (VPA) exposure of rats on day 12.5 leads to neurodevelopmental alterations with autism-like clinical and behavioral symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate potential changes in the excitability of neuronal networks and individual neurons of the hippocampus elicited by prenatal VPA treatment. As there are marked sex differences in ASD, offspring of both sexes were systematically tested, using two different age groups, to elucidate eventual differences in neurodevelopment after VPA treatment. Excitatory connections and long-term synaptic plasticity as well as intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells were examined. Pregnant female Wistar rats received saline or 500 mg/kg VPA i. p. on gestation day 12.5. Brain slices of 6-week-old and 3-month-old offspring were investigated using extra- and intracellular electrophysiological techniques. Field potential- and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were carried out to measure network excitability and single cell activity in the CA1 region hippocampus. Enhanced excitability of hippocampal networks was detected in the 6-week-old VPA-treated male rats; however, this change could not be observed in 3-month-old males. Intrinsic excitability of single neurons, however, was increased in 3-month-old males. In 6-week-old treated females, the most prominent effect of VPA was an increase in voltage sag, to a similar degree to the neurons of the older age group. In 3-month-old females, a network excitability increase could be demonstrated, in a lesser degree than in younger males. It can be concluded, that VPA treatment had diverse effects on hippocampal excitability depending on the sex and the age of the animals. We found that certain alterations manifested in 6-week-old rats were compensated later, on the other hand, other changes persisted until the age of 3 months.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Inhibitory microcircuits play an essential role in regulating cortical responses to sensory stimuli. Interneurons that inhibit dendritic or somatic integration act as gatekeepers for neural activity, synaptic plasticity, and the formation of sensory representations. Conversely, interneurons that selectively inhibit other interneurons can open gates through disinhibition. In the anterior piriform cortex, relief of inhibition permits associative LTP of excitatory synapses between pyramidal neurons. However, the interneurons and circuits mediating disinhibition have not been elucidated. In this study, we use an optogenetic approach in mice of both sexes to identify the inhibitory interneurons and disinhibitory circuits that regulate LTP. We focused on three prominent interneuron classes: somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons. We find that LTP is gated by the inactivation SST or PV interneurons and by the activation of VIP interneurons. Further, VIP interneurons strongly inhibit putative SST cells during LTP induction but only weakly inhibit PV interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that VIP interneurons mediate a disinhibitory circuit that gates synaptic plasticity during the formation of olfactory representations. Inhibitory interneurons stabilize neural activity during sensory processing. However, inhibition must also be modulated to allow sensory experience shape neural responses. In olfactory cortex, inhibition regulates activity-dependent increases in excitatory synaptic strength that accompany odor learning. We identify two inhibitory interneuron classes that act as gatekeepers preventing excitatory enhancement. We demonstrate that driving a third class of interneurons inhibits the gatekeepers and opens the gate for excitatory enhancement. All three inhibitory neuron classes comprise disinhibitory microcircuit motifs found throughout the cortex. Our findings suggest that a common disinhibitory microcircuit promotes changes in synaptic strength during sensory processing and learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The hippocampal formation is one of the brain systems in which the functional roles of coordinated oscillations in information representation and communication are better studied. Within this circuit, neuronal oscillations are conceived as a mechanism to precisely coordinate upstream and downstream neuronal ensembles, underlying dynamic exchange of information. Within a global reference framework provided by theta (θ) oscillations, different gamma-frequency (γ) carriers would temporally segregate information originating from different sources, thereby allowing networks to disambiguate convergent inputs. Two γ sub-bands were thus defined according to their frequency (slow γ, 30-80 Hz; medium γ, 60-120 Hz) and differential power distribution across CA1 dendritic layers. According to this prevalent model, layer-specific γ oscillations in CA1 would reliably identify the temporal dynamics of afferent inputs and may therefore aid in identifying specific memory processes (encoding for medium γ vs. retrieval for slow γ). However, this influential view, derived from time-averages of either specific γ sub-bands or different projection methods, might not capture the complexity of CA1 θ-γ interactions. Recent studies investigating γ oscillations at the θ cycle timescale have revealed a more dynamic and diverse landscape of θ-γ motifs, with many θ cycles containing multiple γ bouts of various frequencies. To properly capture the hippocampal oscillatory complexity, we have argued in this review that we should consider the entirety of the data and its multidimensional complexity. This will call for a revision of the actual model and will require the use of new tools allowing the description of individual γ bouts in their full complexity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease. Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety are associated with poorer treatment response and disease control in asthmatic patients. To date, there is no experimental evidence describing the role of peripheral inflammation on the oscillatory activities in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), two major brain structures modulating anxiety. In the present work we evaluated lung and brain inflammatory responses, anxiety-like behavior, in association with oscillatory features of the ACC-BLA circuit in an animal model of allergic inflammation. Our data showed that allergic inflammation induced anxiety-like behavior and reactivation of microglia and astrocytes in ACC and BLA. Allergic inflammation also enhanced neuronal activities and functional connectivity of the ACC-BLA circuit which were correlated with the level of anxiety. Together, we suggest that disruption in the dynamic oscillatory activities of the ACC-BLA circuit, maybe due to regional inflammation, is an underlying mechanism of allergic asthma-induced anxiety-like behavior. Our findings could pave the way for better understanding the neuro-pathophysiology of the psychiatric disorders observed in asthmatic patients, possibly leading to develop novel treatment strategies.',\n",

Whether these experience-dependent changes of responses in V1 depend on modifications of the local circuit or are the consequence of circuit changes outside of V1 remains unclear. Here, we probed the role of -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent signaling, which is known to be involved in neuronal plasticity, in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) during visuomotor development. We used a local knockout of NMDA receptors and a photoactivatable inhibition of CaMKII in V1 during the first visual experience to probe for changes in neuronal activity in V1 as well as the influence on performance in a visuomotor task. We found that a knockout of NMDA receptors before, but not after, first visuomotor experience reduced responses to unpredictable stimuli, diminished the suppression of predictable feedback in V1, and impaired visuomotor skill learning later in life.

Visual cortex is associated with enhanced representations of relevant stimulus features, whereas the contributions of subcortical circuits are less well understood but have been associated with selection of relevant spatial locations and suppression of distracting stimuli. As a step toward understanding these subcortical circuits, here we identified how neuronal activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC) of head-fixed mice is modulated during covert visual attention. We found that spatial cues modulated both firing rate and spike-count correlations. Crucially, the cue-related modulation in firing rate was due to enhancement of activity at the cued spatial location rather than suppression at the uncued location, indicating that SC neurons in our task were modulated by an excitatory or disinhibitory circuit mechanism focused on the relevant location, rather than broad inhibition of irrelevant locations. This modulation improved the neuronal discriminability of visual-change-evoked activity, but only when assessed for neuronal activity between the contralateral and ipsilateral SC. Together, our findings indicate that neurons in the mouse SC can contribute to covert visual selective attention by biasing processing in favor of locations expected to contain task-relevant information.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Dendrite and axon arbor sizes are critical to neuronal function and vary widely between different neuron types. The relative dendrite and axon sizes of synaptic partners control signal convergence and divergence in neural circuits. The developmental mechanisms that determine cell-type-specific dendrite and axon size and match synaptic partners' arbor territories remain obscure. Here, we discover that retinal horizontal cells express the leucine-rich repeat domain cell adhesion molecule AMIGO1. Horizontal cells provide pathway-specific feedback to photoreceptors-horizontal cell axons to rods and horizontal cell dendrites to cones. AMIGO1 selectively expands the size of horizontal cell axons. When  is deleted in all or individual horizontal cells of either sex, their axon arbors shrink. By contrast, horizontal cell dendrites and synapse formation of horizontal cell axons and dendrites are unaffected by AMIGO1 removal. The dendrites of rod bipolar cells, which do not express AMIGO1, shrink in parallel with horizontal cell axons in  () mice. This territory matching maintains the function of the rod bipolar pathway, preserving bipolar cell responses and retinal output signals in  mice. We previously identified AMIGO2 as a scaling factor that constrains retinal neurite arbors. Our current results identify AMIGO1 as a scaling factor that expands retinal neurite arbors and reveal territory matching as a novel homeostatic mechanism. Territory matching interacts with other homeostatic mechanisms to stabilize the development of the rod bipolar pathway, which mediates vision near the threshold. Neurons send and receive signals through branched axonal and dendritic arbors. The size of these arbors is critical to the function of a neuron. Axons and dendrites grow during development and are stable at maturity. The mechanisms that determine axon and dendrite size are not well understood. Here, we identify a cell surface protein, AMIGO1, that selectively promotes axon growth of horizontal cells, a retinal interneuron. Removal of AMIGO1 reduces the size of horizontal cell axons without affecting the size of their dendrites or the ability of both arbors to form connections. The changes in horizontal cell axons are matched by changes in synaptic partner dendrites to stabilize retinal function. This identifies territory matching as a novel homeostatic plasticity mechanism.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated that the mesolimbic pathway, known to work as reward neuronal circuitry, regulates cognitive-behavioral flexibility in prolonged anorexia nervosa (AN). Although AN is associated with the highest mortality rate among psychiatric disorders, there have been few neuropathological studies on this topic. This study aims to identify alterations of the reward circuitry regions, especially in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), using AN brain tissues. The neuronal networks in AN cases and controls were examined by immunohistochemistry directed at tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; dopaminergic neuron marker) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocyte marker). We also immunochemically analyzed frozen samples presenting astrogliosis, especially in the NAcc and striatum. Histologically, neuronal deformation with cytoplasmic shrinkage was seen in reward-related brain regions, such as the orbitofrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex. The NAcc showed massive GFAP-positive astrocytes and dot-like protrusions of astrocytes in the shell compartment. In the shell, TH and GFAP immunoreactivities revealed prominent astrogliosis within striosomes, which receive projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The numbers of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the NAcc (P\\u2009=\\xa00.0079) and VTA (P\\u2009=\\xa00.0025) of AN cases were significantly higher than those of controls. Strongly immunoreactive 18\\u2009to\\u200925 kDa bands, which might represent degradation products, were detected only in the NAcc of AN cases. Clinically, all cases presented cognitive rigidity, which might reflect a deficit of the reward pathway. Our findings suggest impaired dopaminergic innervation between the NAcc and VTA in AN. Functional dysconnectivity in the reward-related network might induce neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AN. ',\n",

We used the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca sensor GCaMP6f to compare the pharmacological effects of isoflurane, sevoflurane, propofol, and ketamine on presynaptic excitability in hippocampal glutamatergic neurones and in hippocampal parvalbumin-, somatostatin-, and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (PV, SST, and VIP, respectively) GABAergic interneurones.

An integral part to understanding neural circuits is a full census of the constituent parts, i.e., the neural cell types. This census can be based on different characteristics. Previously combinations of morphology and physiology, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility have been used in various cortical and subcortical regions. This has given an extensive yet incomplete overview of neural cell types. However, these techniques have not been applied to all brain regions. Here we apply single cell analysis of accessible chromatin on two similar but different cortical regions, the medial and the lateral entorhinal cortices. Even though these two regions are anatomically similar, their intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity are different. In 4,136 cells we identify 20 different clusters representing different cell types. As expected, excitatory cells show regionally specific clusters, whereas inhibitory neurons are shared between regions. We find that several deep layer excitatory neuronal cell types as defined by chromatin profile are also shared between the two different regions. Integration with a larger scRNA-seq dataset maintains this shared characteristic for cells in Layer Vb. Interestingly, this layer contains three clusters, two specific to either subregion and one shared between the two. These clusters can be putatively associated with particular functional and anatomical cell types found in this layer. This information is a step forwards into elucidating the cell types within the entorhinal circuit and by extension its functional underpinnings.',\n",

Here we propose a biologically-plausible computational model to address this knowledge gap. By coordinating synaptic plasticity timescales and incorporating a hippocampus-thalamus-cortex circuit, our model is able to couple engram reactivations across these regions and thereby reproduce key dynamics of cortical and hippocampal engram cells along with their interdependencies. Decoupling hippocampal-thalamic-cortical activity disrupts systems consolidation. Critically, our model yields testable predictions regarding hippocampal and thalamic engram cells, inhibitory engrams, thalamic inhibitory input, and the effect of thalamocortical synaptic coupling on retrograde amnesia induced by hippocampal lesions.

The pacemaker kernel that drives the network rhythm was responsive to light when synaptically isolated, and light shifted the threshold for slow wave and spike activity in the hyperpolarized direction, accounting for the increased activity patterns. Cryptochromes are evolutionarily conserved blue-light photoreceptors that are involved in circadian behaviors. Their activation by light can lead to enhanced neuronal activity. We identified cryptochrome sequences in the C.\\xa0borealis transcriptome as potential mediators of this response and confirmed their expression in pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, which are part of the pacemaker kernel, by single-cell RNA-seq analysis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Microtubules play fundamental roles in the maintenance of neuronal processes and in synaptic function and plasticity. While dynamic microtubules are mainly composed of tyrosinated tubulin, long-lived microtubules contain detyrosinated tubulin, suggesting that the tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination cycle is a key player in the maintenance of microtubule dynamics and neuronal homeostasis, conditions that go awry in neurodegenerative diseases. In the tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the C-terminal tyrosine of α-tubulin is removed by tubulin carboxypeptidases and re-added by tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL). Here we show that TTL heterozygous mice exhibit decreased tyrosinated microtubules, reduced dendritic spine density and both synaptic plasticity and memory deficits. We further report decreased TTL expression in sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease, and reduced microtubule dynamics in human neurons harbouring the familial APP-V717I mutation. Finally, we show that synapses visited by dynamic microtubules are more resistant to oligomeric amyloid-β peptide toxicity and that expression of TTL, by restoring microtubule entry into spines, suppresses the loss of synapses induced by amyloid-β peptide. Together, our results demonstrate that a balanced tyrosination/detyrosination tubulin cycle is necessary for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity, is protective against amyloid-β peptide-induced synaptic damage and that this balance is lost in Alzheimer's disease, providing evidence that defective tubulin retyrosination may contribute to circuit dysfunction during neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

Here we probe the molecular and neuronal mechanisms that orchestrate the transition from feeding to courtship in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that feeding is prioritized over courtship in starved males, and the consumption of protein-rich food rapidly reverses this order within a few minutes. At the molecular level, a gut-derived, nutrient-specific neuropeptide hormone-Diuretic hormone 31 (Dh31)-propels a switch from feeding to courtship. We further address the underlying kinetics with calcium imaging experiments. Amino acids from food acutely activate Dh31 enteroendocrine cells in the gut, increasing Dh31 levels in the circulation. In addition, three-photon functional imaging of intact flies shows that optogenetic stimulation of Dh31 enteroendocrine cells rapidly excites a subset of brain neurons that express Dh31 receptor (Dh31R). Gut-derived Dh31 excites the brain neurons through the circulatory system within a few minutes, in line with the speed of the feeding-courtship behavioural switch. At the circuit level, there are two distinct populations of Dh31R neurons in the brain, with one population inhibiting feeding through allatostatin-C and the other promoting courtship through corazonin. Together, our findings illustrate a mechanism by which the consumption of protein-rich food triggers the release of a gut hormone, which in turn prioritizes courtship over feeding through two parallel pathways.',\n",

The recent discovery of similar activity in the developing Drosophila central nervous system suggests that developmental activity is fundamental to the assembly of complex brains. How such activity is coordinated across disparate brain regions to influence synaptic development at the level of defined cell types is not well understood. Here we show that neurons expressing the cation channel transient receptor potential gamma (Trpγ) relay and pattern developmental activity throughout the Drosophila brain. In trpγ mutants, activity is attenuated globally, and both patterns of activity and synapse structure are altered in a cell-type-specific manner. Less than 2% of the neurons in the brain express Trpγ. These neurons arborize throughout the brain, and silencing or activating them leads to loss or gain of brain-wide activity. Together, these results indicate that this small population of neurons coordinates brain-wide developmental activity. We propose that stereotyped patterns of developmental activity are driven by a discrete, genetically specified network to instruct neural circuit assembly at the level of individual cells and synapses. This work establishes the fly brain as an experimentally tractable system for studying how activity contributes to synapse and circuit formation.',\n",

In combination with two-photon microscopy and unbiased, event-based analysis, we investigated cortical astrocytes embedded in the vibrissal thalamocortical circuit. We found a wide range of Ca MD signals, some of which were ultrafast (≤300 ms). Frequency and size of signals were extensively increased by locomotion but only subtly with sensory stimulation. The overlay of these signals resulted in behavior-dependent maps with characteristic Ca activity hotspots, maybe representing memory engrams.

Here, using two rodent models of absence epilepsy, we show that hypoglycaemia increases the occurrence of spike-wave seizures. We then show that selectively disrupting glycolysis in the thalamus, a structure implicated in absence epilepsy, is sufficient to increase spike-wave seizures. We propose that activation of thalamic AMP-activated protein kinase, a sensor of cellular energetic stress and potentiator of metabotropic GABAB-receptor function, is a significant driver of hypoglycaemia-induced spike-wave seizures. We show that AMP-activated protein kinase augments postsynaptic GABAB-receptor-mediated currents in thalamocortical neurons and strengthens epileptiform network activity evoked in thalamic brain slices. Selective thalamic AMP-activated protein kinase activation also increases spike-wave seizures. Finally, systemic administration of metformin, an AMP-activated protein kinase agonist and common diabetes treatment, profoundly increased spike-wave seizures.

Although the plasticity mechanisms of presynaptic photoreceptor neurons in the Drosophila visual system have been well studied, postsynaptic modifications remain elusive. In addition, further studies on the adaption of the visual system to different light experiences at a circuitry scale are required. Using the modified transcriptional reporter of intracellular Ca method, we describe a way to visualize circuitry changes according to different light experiences. We found enhanced postsynaptic neuronal activity responses in lamina monopolar neuron L2 after prolonged light treatment. Although L1 also has connections with photoreceptors, there were no enhanced activity responses in L1. We also report in this study that activity-dependent transcriptional downregulation of inhibitory histamine receptor (HR), Ort, occurs in postsynaptic neuron L2, but not in L1, during continuous light conditions. We produced exogenous Ort proteins in L2 neurons and found that it attenuated the enhanced activity response caused by constant light exposure. These findings, together with the fact that histamine is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter released by photoreceptors in the Drosophila visual system, confirmed our hypothesis that the activity-dependent transcriptional downregulation of HR is responsible for the constant light exposure-induced circuitry response changes in L2. The results successfully demonstrated the selective circuit change after synaptic remodeling evoked by long-term activation and provided in vivo evidence of circuitry plasticity upon long-term environmental stimulation.',\n",

Various experimental approaches have been used in applying these lines of research to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disease. Although valuable, data on movement are often limited by the shortcomings inherent in the data collection process itself. Steve Fowler and his research group have been instrumental in pioneering a technology that both minimizes these pitfalls in studies of rodent behavior and has applications to research on human patients. At the center of this technology is the force-plate actometer, developed by the Fowler group to assess multiple aspects of movement in rodent models. Our review highlights how use of the actometer and related behavioral measurements provides valuable insight into Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal dominant condition of progressively deteriorating behavioral control. HD typically emerges in mid-life and has been replicated in multiple genetically engineered mouse models. The actometer also can be a valuable addition to cutting-edge neuronal and synaptic technologies that are now increasingly applied to studies of behaving animals.

The role of glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia in shaping synapses and circuits have been covered in other reviews in this journal and elsewhere. This review summarizes the role of another glial cell type, oligodendrocytes, in shaping synapse formation, neuronal circuit development, and myelination in both normal development and in demyelinating disease. Oligodendrocytes ensheath and insulate neuronal axons with myelin, and this facilitates fast conduction of electrical nerve impulses via saltatory conduction. Oligodendrocytes also proliferate during postnatal development, and defects in their maturation have been linked to abnormal myelination. Myelination also regulates the timing of activity in neural circuits and is important for maintaining the health of axons and providing nutritional support. Recent studies have shown that dysfunction in oligodendrocyte development and in myelination can contribute to defects in neuronal synapse formation and circuit development. We discuss glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors and voltage gated ion channel expression and function in oligodendrocyte development and myelination. We explain the role of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission on oligodendrocyte proliferation, migration, differentiation, and myelination. We then focus on how our understanding of the synaptic connectivity between neurons and OPCs can inform future therapeutics in demyelinating disease, and discuss gaps in the literature that would inform new therapies for remyelination.',\n",

Surprisingly, it has also been shown to possess reward-related activity, presumably to facilitate reward-based learning of new movements. However, whether reward-related signals are represented among different cell types in M1, and whether their response properties change after cue-reward conditioning remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal in vivo two-photon Ca imaging to monitor the activity of different neuronal cell types in M1 while mice engaged in a classical conditioning task. Our results demonstrate that most of the major neuronal cell types in M1 showed robust but differential responses to both the conditioned cue stimulus (CS) and reward, and their response properties undergo cell-type-specific modifications after associative learning. PV-INs' responses became more reliable to the CS, while VIP-INs' responses became more reliable to reward. Pyramidal neurons only showed robust responses to novel reward, and they habituated to it after associative learning. Lastly, SOM-INs' responses emerged and became more reliable to both the CS and reward after conditioning. These observations suggest that cue- and reward-related signals are preferentially represented among different neuronal cell types in M1, and the distinct modifications they undergo during associative learning could be essential in triggering different aspects of local circuit reorganization in M1 during reward-based motor skill learning.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) is a Gα-coupled GPCR that is expressed in the midbrain and forebrain, regulating motor behavior, reward, motivational states, and cognitive processes. Although the D1R was initially identified as a promising drug target almost 40 years ago, the development of clinically useful ligands has until recently been hampered by a lack of suitable candidate molecules. The emergence of new non-catechol D1R agonists, biased agonists, and allosteric modulators has renewed clinical interest in drugs targeting this receptor, specifically for the treatment of motor impairment in Parkinson's Disease, and cognitive impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders. To develop better therapeutics, advances in ligand chemistry must be matched by an expanded understanding of D1R signaling across cell populations in the brain, and in disease states. Depending on the brain region, the D1R couples primarily to either Gα or Gα through which it activates a cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling cascade that can regulate neuronal excitability, stimulate gene expression, and facilitate synaptic plasticity. However, like many GPCRs, the D1R can signal through multiple downstream pathways, and specific signaling signatures may differ between cell types or be altered in disease. To guide development of improved D1R ligands, it is important to understand how signaling unfolds in specific target cells, and how this signaling affects circuit function and behavior. In this review, we provide a summary of D1R-directed signaling in various neuronal populations and describe how specific pathways have been linked to physiological and behavioral outcomes. In addition, we address the current state of D1R drug development, including the pharmacology of newly developed non-catecholamine ligands, and discuss the potential utility of D1R-agonists in Parkinson's Disease and cognitive impairment.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with hundreds of genes spanning\\xa0a wide range of biological functions. The alterations in the human brain resulting from mutations in these genes remain unclear. Furthermore, their phenotypic manifestation varies across individuals. Here we used organoid models of the human cerebral cortex to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities that result from haploinsufficiency in three ASD risk genes-SUV420H1 (also known as KMT5B), ARID1B and CHD8-in multiple cell lines from different donors, using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of more than 745,000 cells and proteomic analysis of individual organoids, to identify phenotypic convergence. Each of the three mutations confers asynchronous development of two main cortical neuronal lineages-γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing (GABAergic) neurons and deep-layer excitatory projection neurons-but acts through largely distinct molecular pathways. Although these phenotypes are consistent across cell lines, their expressivity is influenced by the individual genomic context, in a manner that is dependent on both the risk gene and the developmental defect. Calcium imaging in intact organoids shows that these early-stage developmental changes are followed by abnormal circuit activity. This research uncovers cell-type-specific neurodevelopmental abnormalities that are shared across ASD risk genes and are finely modulated by human genomic context, finding convergence in the neurobiological basis of how different risk genes contribute to ASD pathology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A cardinal feature of the neocortex is the progressive increase of the spatial receptive fields along the cortical hierarchy. Recently, theoretical and experimental findings have shown that the temporal response windows also gradually enlarge, so that early sensory neural circuits operate on short timescales whereas higher-association areas are capable of integrating information over a long period of time. While an increased receptive field is accounted for by spatial summation of inputs from neurons in an upstream area, the emergence of timescale hierarchy cannot be readily explained, especially given the dense interareal cortical connectivity known in the modern connectome. To uncover the required neurobiological properties, we carried out a rigorous analysis of an anatomically based large-scale cortex model of macaque monkeys. Using a perturbation method, we show that the segregation of disparate timescales is defined in terms of the localization of eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix, which depends on three circuit properties: 1) a macroscopic gradient of synaptic excitation, 2) distinct electrophysiological properties between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and 3) a detailed balance between long-range excitatory inputs and local inhibitory inputs for each area-to-area pathway. Our work thus provides a quantitative understanding of the mechanism underlying the emergence of timescale hierarchy in large-scale primate cortical networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Extracellular microelectrode techniques are the most widely used approach to interrogate neuronal populations. However, regardless of the manufacturing method used, damage to the vasculature and circuit function during probe insertion remains a concern. This issue can be mitigated by minimising the footprint of the probe used. Reducing the size of probes typically requires either a reduction in the number of channels present in the probe, or a reduction in the individual channel area. Both lead to less effective coupling between the probe and extracellular signals of interest.Here, we show that continuously drawn SiO-insulated ultra-microelectrode fibres offer an attractive substrate to address these challenges. Individual fibres can be fabricated to >10 m continuous stretches and a selection of diameters below 30m with low resistance (<100 Ω mm) continuously conductive metal core of <10m and atomically flat smooth shank surfaces. To optimize the properties of the miniaturised electrode-tissue interface, we electrodeposit rough Au structures followed by ∼20 nm IrOx film resulting in the reduction of the interfacial impedance to <500 kΩ at 1 kHz.. We demonstrate that these ultra-low impedance electrodes can record and stimulate both single and multi-unit activity with minimal tissue disturbance and exceptional signal-to-noise ratio in both superficial (∼40m) and deep (∼6 mm) structures of the mouse brain. Further, we show that sensor modifications are stable and probe manufacturing is reproducible.Minimally perturbing bidirectional neural interfacing can reveal circuit function in the mammalian brain',\n",

This polarity emerges sequentially in development, starting with the directed migration of neuronal precursors, which subsequently elaborate neurites that form synapses in specific locations. In other organs, Fat cadherins sense the position and then polarize individual cells by inducing localized changes in the cytoskeleton that are coordinated across the tissue. Here, we show that the Fat-related protein Fat3 plays an analogous role during the assembly of polarized circuits in the murine retina. We find that the Fat3 intracellular domain (ICD) binds to cytoskeletal regulators and synaptic proteins, with discrete motifs required for amacrine cell migration and neurite retraction. Moreover, upon ICD deletion, extra neurites form but do not make ectopic synapses, suggesting that Fat3 independently regulates synapse localization. Thus, Fat3 serves as a molecular node to coordinate asymmetric cell behaviors across development.',\n",

However, the anatomical and functional connections between the brain and insulin-producing pancreatic β cells remain undefined. Here, we describe a functional transneuronal circuit connecting the hypothalamus to β cells in mice. This circuit originates from a subpopulation of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), and it reaches the islets of the endocrine pancreas via the sympathetic autonomic branch to innervate β cells. Stimulation of PVN neurons rapidly suppresses insulin secretion and causes hyperglycemia. Conversely, silencing of these neurons elevates insulin levels by dysregulating neuronal signaling and secretory pathways in β cells and induces hypoglycemia. PVN neuronal activity is triggered by glucoprivation. Our findings reveal that a subset of PVN neurons form functional multisynaptic circuits with β cells in mice to regulate insulin secretion, and their function is necessary for the β cell response to hypoglycemia.',\n",

Much of the theoretical pathophysiology put forth to explain the emergence of PPD overlaps with that of major depressive disorder (MDD) and, although not conventionally described in such terms, can be seen as neurodegenerative in nature. Framing the disorder from the perspective of the well-established inflammatory theory of depression, symptoms are thought to be driven by dysregulation, and subsequent hyperactivation of the body's immune response to stress. Compounded by physiological stressors such as drastic fluctuations in hormone signaling, physical and psychosocial stressors placed upon new mothers lay bare a number of significant vulnerabilities, or points of potential failure, in systems critical for maintaining healthy brain function. The inability to compensate or properly adapt to meet the changing demands placed upon these systems has the potential to damage neurons, hinder neuronal growth and repair, and disrupt neuronal circuit integrity such that essential functional outputs like mood and cognition are altered. The impact of this deterioration in brain function, which includes depressive symptoms, extends to the child who relies on the mother for critical life-sustaining care as well as important cognitive stimulation, accentuating the need for further research.\",\n",

Although the retina contains diverse types of neuronal based-photoreceptors cells, originally classified as ciliary- or rhabdomeric-like types, in recent years, it has been shown that the major glial cell type of the retina, the Müller glial cells (MC), express blue photopigments as Opn3 (encephalopsin) and Opn5 (neuropsin) and display light responses associated to intracellular Ca2\\u2009+\\u2009mobilization. These findings strongly propose MC as novel retinal photodetectors (Rios et al., 2019). Herein, we further investigated the intrinsic light responses of primary cultures of MC from embryonic chicken retinas specially focused on Ca2\\u2009+\\u2009mobilization by fluorescence imaging and the identity of the internal Ca2\\u2009+\\u2009stores responsible for blue light responses. Results clearly demonstrated that light responses were specific to blue light of long time exposure, and that the main Ca2\\u2009+\\u2009reservoir to trigger downstream responses came from intracellular stores localized in the endoplasmic reticulum These observations bring more complexity to the intrinsic photosensitivity of retinal cells, particularly with regard to the detection of light in the blue range of visible spectra, and add novel functions to glial cells cooperating with other photoreceptors to detect and integrate ambient light in the retinal circuit and participate in cell to cell communication.Non-neuronal cells in the vertebrate retina, Muller glial cells, express non-canonical photopigments and sense blue light causing calcium release from intracellular stores strongly suggesting a novel intrinsic photosensitivity and new regulatory events mediating light-driven processes with yet unknown physiological implications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Emotional stress is considered a severe pathogenetic factor of psychiatric disorders. However, the circuit mechanisms remain largely unclear. Using a three-chamber vicarious social defeat stress (3C-VSDS) model in mice, we here show that chronic emotional stress (CES) induces anxiety-like behavior and transient social interaction changes. Dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) are required to control this behavioral deficit. VTA dopaminergic neuron hyperactivity induced by CES is involved in the anxiety-like behavior in the innate anxiogenic environment. Chemogenetic activation of VTA dopaminergic neurons directly triggers anxiety-like behavior, while chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons promotes resilience to the CES-induced anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, VTA dopaminergic neurons receiving nucleus accumbens (NAc) projections are activated in CES mice. Bidirectional modulation of the NAc-VTA circuit mimics or reverses the CES-induced anxiety-like behavior. In conclusion, we propose that a NAc-VTA circuit critically establishes and regulates the CES-induced anxiety-like behavior. This study not only characterizes a preclinical model that is representative of the nuanced aspect of CES, but also provides insight to the circuit-level neuronal processes that underlie empathy-like behavior.',\n",

Circuit tracing using G-deleted rabies virus (RVΔG) vectors permits the brain-wide labeling of presynaptic inputs to targeted single neurons. However, the experimental procedures are complex, and the success rate of circuit labeling is low because of the lack of validation to increase the accuracy and efficiency of monosynaptic RVΔG tracing from targeted single neurons. We established an efficient RVΔG tracing method from projection target-defined single neurons using TVA950, a transmembrane isoform of TVA receptors, for initial viral infection. Presynaptic neurons were transsynaptically labeled from 80 % of the TVA950-expressing single starter neurons that survived after infection with EnvA-pseudotyped RVΔG in the adult mouse brain. We labeled single neuronal networks in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas, namely the posteromedial area (PM) and anteromedial area (AM), as well as the single neuronal networks of PM-projecting V1 single neurons. Monosynaptic RVΔG tracing from projection-targeted single neurons revealed the input-output organization of single neuronal networks.

However, how the nervous system processes signals of two odorants present simultaneously to generate a coherent behavioral response is poorly understood. Here, we characterize circuit basis for a form of olfactory integration in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that the presence of a repulsive odorant, 2-nonanone, that signals threat strongly blocks the attraction of other odorants, such as isoamyl alcohol (IAA) or benzaldehyde, that signal food. Using a forward genetic screen, we found that genes known to regulate the structure and function of sensory neurons, osm-5 and osm-1, played a critical role in the integration process. Loss of these genes mildly reduces the response to the repellent 2-nonanone and disrupts the integration effect. Restoring the function of OSM-5 in either AWB or ASH, two sensory neurons known to mediate 2-nonanone-evoked avoidance, is sufficient to rescue. Sensory neurons AWB and downstream interneurons AVA, AIB, RIM that play critical roles in olfactory sensorimotor response are able to process signals generated by 2-nonanone or IAA or the mixture of the two odorants and contribute to the integration. Thus, our results identify redundant neural circuits that regulate the robust effect of a repulsive odorant to block responses to attractive odorants and uncover the neuronal and cellular basis for this complex olfactory task.',\n",

The current study is aimed at identifying how cell-specific loss of D2Rs in the cerebral cortex may impact neurobehavioral and cellular development, in order to better understand the roles of this receptor in cortical circuit formation and brain disorders. We deleted D2R from developing cortical GABAergic interneurons (-Cre) or from developing telencephalic glutamatergic neurons (-Cre). Conditional knockouts (cKO) from both lines,  ,   (referred to as GABA-D2R-cKO mice) or  ,   (referred to as Glu-D2R-cKO mice), exhibited no differences in simple tests of anxiety-related or depression-related behaviors, or spatial or nonspatial working memory. Both GABA-D2R-cKO and Glu-D2R-cKO mice also had normal basal locomotor activity, but GABA-D2R-cKO mice expressed blunted locomotor responses to the psychotomimetic drug MK-801. GABA-D2R-cKO mice exhibited improved motor coordination on a rotarod whereas Glu-D2R-cKO mice were normal. GABA-D2R-cKO mice also exhibited spatial learning deficits without changes in reversal learning on a Barnes maze. At the cellular level, we observed an increase in PV+ cells in the frontal cortex of GABA-D2R-cKO mice and no noticeable changes in Glu-D2R-cKO mice. These data point toward unique and distinct roles for D2Rs within excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the regulation of behavior and interneuron development, and suggest that location-biased D2R pharmacology may be clinically advantageous to achieve higher efficacy and help avoid unwanted effects.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neurons have specialized structures that facilitate information transfer using electrical and chemical signals. Within the perspective of neural computation, the neuronal structure is an important prerequisite for the versatile computational capabilities of neurons resulting from the integration of diverse synaptic input patterns, complex interactions among the passive and active dendritic local currents, and the interplay between dendrite and soma to generate action potential output. For this, characterization of the relationship between the structure and neuronal spike dynamics could provide essential information about the cellular-level mechanism supporting neural computations. This work describes simulations and an information-theoretic analysis to investigate how specific neuronal structure affects neural dynamics and information processing. Correlation analysis on the Allen Cell Types Database reveals biologically relevant structural features that determine neural dynamics-eight highly correlated structural features are selected as the primary set for characterizing neuronal structures. These features are used to characterize biophysically realistic multi-compartment mathematical models for primary neurons in the direct and indirect hippocampal pathways consisting of the pyramidal cells of Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and CA3 and the granule cell in the dentate gyrus (DG). Simulations reveal that the dynamics of these neurons vary depending on their specialized structures and are highly sensitive to structural modifications. Information-theoretic analysis confirms that structural factors are critical for versatile neural information processing at a single-cell and a neural circuit level; not only basic AND/OR but also linearly non-separable XOR functions can be explained within the information-theoretic framework. Providing quantitative information on the relationship between the structure and the dynamics/information flow of neurons, this work would help us understand the design and coding principles of biological neurons and may be beneficial for designing biologically plausible neuron models for artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

We systemically examined this question at synapses onto newly characterized dendritic spines of C. elegans GABAergic motor neurons. We show that the presynaptic adhesion protein neurexin/NRX-1 is required for stabilization of postsynaptic structure. We find that early postsynaptic developmental events proceed without a strict requirement for synaptic activity and are not disrupted by deletion of neurexin/nrx-1. However, in the absence of presynaptic NRX-1, dendritic spines and receptor clusters become destabilized and collapse prior to adulthood. We demonstrate that NRX-1 delivery to presynaptic terminals is dependent on kinesin-3/UNC-104 and show that ongoing UNC-104 function is required for postsynaptic maintenance in mature animals. By defining the dynamics and temporal order of synapse formation and maintenance events in vivo, we describe a mechanism for stabilizing mature circuit connectivity through neurexin-based adhesion.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The functional understanding of genetic interaction networks and cellular mechanisms governing health and disease requires the dissection, and multifaceted study, of discrete cell subtypes in developing and adult animal models. Recombinase-driven expression of transgenic effector alleles represents a significant and powerful approach to delineate cell populations for functional, molecular, and anatomical studies. In addition to single recombinase systems, the expression of two recombinases in distinct, but partially overlapping, populations allows for more defined target expression. Although the application of this method is becoming increasingly popular, its experimental implementation has been broadly restricted to manipulations of a limited set of common alleles that are often commercially produced at great expense, with costs and technical challenges associated with production of intersectional mouse lines hindering customized approaches to many researchers. Here, we present a simplified CRISPR toolkit for rapid, inexpensive, and facile intersectional allele production. Briefly, we produced 7 intersectional mouse lines using a dual recombinase system, one mouse line with a single recombinase system, and three embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that are designed to study the way functional, molecular, and anatomical features relate to each other in building circuits that underlie physiology and behavior. As a proof-of-principle, we applied three of these lines to different neuronal populations for anatomical mapping and functional in vivo investigation of respiratory control. We also generated a mouse line with a single recombinase-responsive allele that controls the expression of the calcium sensor Twitch-2B. This mouse line was applied globally to study the effects of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) on calcium release in the ovarian follicle. The lines presented here are representative examples of outcomes possible with the successful application of our genetic toolkit for the facile development of diverse, modifiable animal models. This toolkit will allow labs to create single or dual recombinase effector lines easily for any cell population or subpopulation of interest when paired with the appropriate Cre and FLP recombinase mouse lines or viral vectors. We have made our tools and derivative intersectional mouse and ES cell lines openly available for non-commercial use through publicly curated repositories for plasmid DNA, ES cells, and transgenic mouse lines.

Previous studies indicate that testosterone is crucial for neuronal functions and required further investigation on various frontiers. However, it is surprising to note that studies on testosterone-induced neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) expression and its influence on synaptic plasticity and learning and memory moderation are scanty. The present study is focused on analysing the localized influence of NT-4 on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and associated moderation in learning and memory under testosterone deprivation. Adult Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into various groups, control (Cont), orchidectomy (ORX), ORX + testosterone supplementation (ORX + T), and Cont + testosterone (Cont + T). After 2 weeks, the serum testosterone level was undetectable in ORX rats. The behavioural assessment showed a decline in the learning ability of ORX rats with increased working and reference memory errors in the behavioural assessment in the 8-arm radial maze. The mRNA and protein expressions of NT-4 and androgen receptors (ARs) were significantly reduced in the ORX group. In addition, there was a decrease in the number of neuronal dendrites in Golgi-Cox staining. These changes were not seen in ORX + T rats with improved learning behaviour indicating that testosterone exerts its protective effect on hippocampal synaptic plasticity through AR-dependent NT-4 regulation in learning and memory upgrade.',\n",

Using large-scale recordings from a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions in behaving mice, we uncover the presence of an intracerebral respiratory corollary discharge, that modulates neural activity across these circuits. During offline states, the respiratory modulation underlies the coupling of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and cortical DOWN/UP state transitions, which mediates systems memory consolidation.

Improved understanding of the neurobiology of mania is expected to allow for novel avenues to address current challenges in its diagnosis and treatment. Previous research focusing on the impairment of functional neuronal circuits and brain networks has resulted in heterogenous findings, possibly due to a focus on bipolar disorder and its several phases, rather than on the unique context of mania. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the evidence regarding the functional neuroanatomy of mania. Our interpretation of the best available evidence is consistent with a convergent model of lateralized circuit dysfunction in mania, with hypoactivity of the ventral prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere, and hyperactivity of the amygdala, basal ganglia, and anterior cingulate cortex in the left hemisphere of the brain.

MDGA1 (meprin, A-5 protein, and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase mu [MAM] domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor protein 1) suppresses synaptic inhibition in mammalian neurons, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying MDGA1-mediated negative regulation of GABAergic synapses remain unresolved. Here, we show that the MDGA1 MAM domain directly interacts with the extension domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Strikingly, MDGA1-mediated synaptic disinhibition requires the MDGA1 MAM domain and is prominent at distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Down-regulation of APP in presynaptic GABAergic interneurons specifically suppressed GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, synaptic transmission strength and inputs onto both the somatic and dendritic compartments of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Moreover, APP deletion manifested differential effects in somatostatin- and parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampal CA1, resulting in distinct alterations in inhibitory synapse numbers, transmission, and excitability. The infusion of MDGA1 MAM protein mimicked postsynaptic MDGA1 gain-of-function phenotypes that involve the presence of presynaptic APP. The overexpression of MDGA1 wild type or MAM, but not MAM-deleted MDGA1, in the hippocampal CA1 impaired novel object-recognition memory in mice. Thus, our results establish unique roles of APP-MDGA1 complexes in hippocampal neural circuits, providing unprecedented insight into -synaptic mechanisms underlying differential tuning of neuronal compartment-specific synaptic inhibition.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A continued effort in neuroscience aims to understand the way brain circuits consisting of diverse neuronal types generate complex behavior following sensory input. A common feature of vertebrate visual systems is that lower-order and higher-order visual areas are reciprocally connected. Feedforward projections confer visual responsiveness to higher-order visual neurons while feedback projections likely serve to modulate responses of lower-order visual neurons in a context-dependent manner. Optic tectum is the largest first-order visual brain area in zebrafish and is reciprocally connected with the torus longitudinalis (TL), a second-order visual brain area that does not receive retinal input. A functional role for feedback projections from TL to tectum has not been identified. Here we aim to understand how this feedback contributes to visual processing. In this study, we demonstrate that TL feedback projections to tectum drive binocular integration and spatial summation in a defined tectal circuit. We performed genetically targeted, cell type-specific functional imaging in tectal pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) and their two input neuron populations: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and neurons in TL. We find that PyrNs encode gradual changes in scene luminance using a complement of three distinct response classes that encode different light intensity ranges. Functional imaging of RGC inputs to tectum suggest that these response classes originate in the retina and RGC input specifies PyrN functional classes. In contrast, TL input serves to endow PyrNs with large, compound receptive fields that span both retinal hemifields. These findings reveal a novel role for the zebrafish TL in driving binocular integration and spatial summation in tectal PyrNs. The neural circuit we describe generates a population of tectal neurons with large receptive fields tailored for detecting changes in the visual scene. ',\n",

While the behavioral response to Fourier motion has been studied in the past, how Fourier motion is represented and processed by sensory brain areas remains elusive. Here, we investigated how visual moving stimuli with or without the first Fourier component (square-wave signal or missing fundamental signal) are represented in the main visual regions of the zebrafish brain. First, we monitored the larva's optokinetic response (OKR) induced by square-wave and missing fundamental signals. Then, we used two-photon microscopy and GCaMP6f zebrafish larvae to monitor neuronal circuit dynamics in the optic tectum and the pretectum. We observed that both the optic tectum and the pretectum circuits responded to the square-wave gratings. However, only the pretectum responded specifically to the direction of the missing-fundamental signal. In addition, a group of neurons in the pretectum responded to the direction of the behavioral output (OKR), independently of the type of stimulus presented. Our results suggest that the optic tectum responds to the different features of the stimulus (e.g., contrast, spatial frequency, direction, etc.), but does not respond to the direction of motion if the motion information is not coherent (e.g., the luminance and the edges and contrast in the missing-fundamental signal). On the other hand, the pretectum mainly responds to the motion of the stimulus based on the Fourier energy.\",\n",

We present a complete platform by which patterns of electricity can be arbitrarily defined and distributed across a brain circuit, either simultaneously, asynchronously, or in complex patterns that can be easily designed and orchestrated with precise timing. Interfacing with acute slices of mouse cortex, we show that our system can be used to activate neurons at many locations and drive synaptic transmission in distributed patterns, and that this elicits new forms of plasticity that may not be observable via traditional methods, including interesting measurements of associational and sequence plasticity.

Although we still lack a complete understanding of how the human brain gives rise to these unique abilities, the past several decades have witnessed significant progress in uncovering some of the genetic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms shaping the development and function of the human brain. These features include an expansion of brain size and in particular cortical expansion, distinct physiological properties of human neurons, and modified synaptic development. Together they specify the human brain as a large primate brain with a unique underlying neuronal circuit architecture. Here, we review some of the known human-specific features of neuronal connectivity, and we outline how novel insights into the human genome led to the identification of human-specific genetic modifiers that played a role in the evolution of human brain development and function.

       "  'abstract': 'The present paper examines the viability of a radically novel idea for brain-computer interface (BCI), which could lead to novel technological, experimental, and clinical applications. BCIs are computer-based systems that enable either one-way or two-way communication between a living brain and an external machine. BCIs read-out brain signals and transduce them into task commands, which are performed by a machine. In closed loop, the machine can stimulate the brain with appropriate signals. In recent years, it has been shown that there is some ultraweak light emission from neurons within or close to the visible and near-infrared parts of the optical spectrum. Such ultraweak photon emission (UPE) reflects the cellular (and body) oxidative status, and compelling pieces of evidence are beginning to emerge that UPE may well play an informational role in neuronal functions. In fact, several experiments point to a direct correlation between UPE intensity and neural activity, oxidative reactions, EEG activity, cerebral blood flow, cerebral energy metabolism, and release of glutamate. Therefore, we propose a novel skull implant BCI that uses UPE. We suggest that a photonic integrated chip installed on the interior surface of the skull may enable a new form of extraction of the relevant features from the UPE signals. In the current technology landscape, photonic technologies are advancing rapidly and poised to overtake many electrical technologies, due to their unique advantages, such as miniaturization, high speed, low thermal effects, and large integration capacity that allow for high yield, volume manufacturing, and lower cost. For our proposed BCI, we are making some very major conjectures, which need to be experimentally verified, and therefore we discuss the controversial parts, feasibility of technology and limitations, and potential impact of this envisaged technology if successfully implemented in the future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Postnatal CNS development is fine-tuned to drive the functional needs of succeeding life stages; accordingly, the emergence of sensory and motor functions, behavioral patterns and cognitive abilities relies on a complex interplay of signaling pathways. Strictly regulated Ca signaling mediated by L-type channels (LTCCs) is crucial in neural circuit development and aberrant increases in neuronal LTCC activity are linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In the amygdala, a brain region that integrates signals associated with aversive and rewarding stimuli, LTCCs contribute to NMDA-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) and are required for the consolidation and extinction of fear memory.  studies have elucidated distinct electrophysiological and synaptic properties characterizing the transition from immature to functionally mature basolateral subdivision of the amygdala (BLA) principal neurons. Further, acute increase of LTCC activity selectively regulates excitability and spontaneous synaptic activity in immature BLA neurons, suggesting an age-dependent regulation of BLA circuitry by LTCCs. This study aimed to elucidate whether early life alterations in LTCC activity subsequently affect synaptic strength and amygdala-dependent behaviors in early adulthood.  intra-amygdala injection of an LTCC agonist at a critical period of postnatal neurodevelopment in male rat pups was used to examine synaptic plasticity of BLA excitatory inputs, expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) and glutamate receptors, as well as anxiety and social affiliation behaviors at a juvenile age. Results indicate that enhanced LTCC activity in immature BLA principal neurons trigger persistent changes in the developmental trajectory to modify membrane properties and synaptic LTP at later stages, concomitant with alterations in amygdala-related behavioral patterns.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common form of childhood muscular dystrophy, is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. In addition to debilitating muscle degeneration, patients display a range of cognitive deficits thought to result from the loss of dystrophin normally expressed in the brain. While the function of dystrophin in muscle tissue is well characterized, its role in the brain is still poorly understood. The highest expression of dystrophin in the mouse brain is in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), where it colocalizes with GABA receptor clusters. Using  electrophysiological recordings from connected molecular layer interneuron (MLI)-PC pairs, we investigated changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission caused by dystrophin deficiency. In male  mice (which lack long-form dystrophin), we found that responses at MLI-PC pairs were reduced by ∼60% because of both decreased quantal response amplitude and a reduced number of functional vesicle release sites. Using electron microscopy, we found significantly fewer and smaller anatomically defined inhibitory synapses contacting the soma of PCs in  mice, suggesting that dystrophin may play a critical role in synapse formation and/or maintenance. Functionally, we found reduced MLI-evoked pauses in PC firing in acute slices.  recordings from awake  mice showed increased sensory-evoked simple spike firing in positively modulating PCs, consistent with reduced feedforward inhibition, but no change in negatively modulating PCs. These data suggest that dystrophin deficiency in PCs disrupts inhibitory signaling in the cerebellar circuit and PC firing patterns, potentially contributing to cognitive and motor deficits observed in  mice and DMD patients. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is primarily characterized by progressive muscle weakening caused by genetic mutations in the gene for dystrophin. Dystrophin is also normally expressed in the CNS, and DMD patients experience a range of nonprogressive cognitive deficits. The pathophysiology of CNS neurons resulting from loss of dystrophin and the function of dystrophin in neurons are still poorly understood. Using cerebellar PCs as a model, we found that the loss of dystrophin specifically disrupts the number and strength of inhibitory synaptic connections, suggesting that dystrophin participates in formation and/or maintenance of these synapses. This work provides insight into the function of dystrophin in the CNS and establishes neuronal and synaptic dysfunction, which may underlie cognitive deficits in DMD.',\n",

Using mouse genetics, physiological, anatomical, and behavioral assays, we demonstrate that VSCTs exhibit rhythmogenic properties and neuronal circuit connectivity consistent with their essential role in the locomotor CPG.

Prior to sleep onset, many animal species display characteristic behaviors, including finding a safe location, performing hygiene-related behaviors, and preparing a space for sleep. It has been proposed that the pre-sleep period is a transitional phase in which engaging in a specific behavioral repertoire de-arouses the brain and facilitates the wake-to-sleep transition, yet both causal evidence for this premise and an understanding of the neuronal circuit elements involved are lacking. Here, we combine detailed behavioral observations, EEG-EMG recordings, selective targeting, and activity modulation of pre-sleep-active neurons to reveal the behaviors preceding sleep initiation and their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. We show that mice engage in temporally structured behaviors with stereotypic EEG signatures prior to sleep and that nest-building and grooming become significantly more prevalent with sleep proximity. We next demonstrate that the ability to build a nest promotes the initiation and consolidation of sleep and that the lack of nesting material chronically fragments sleep. Lastly, we identify broadly projecting and predominantly glutamatergic neuronal ensembles in the lateral hypothalamus that regulate the motivation to engage in pre-sleep nest-building behavior and gate sleep initiation and intensity. Our study provides causal evidence for the facilitatory role of pre-sleep behaviors in sleep initiation and consolidation and a functional characterization of the neuronal underpinnings regulating a sleep-related and goal-directed complex behavior.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions forming the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses, undergo activity-dependent molecular and structural remodeling. Activation of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) by synaptic or pharmacological stimulation, induces LTD, but whether this is accompanied with spine elimination remains unresolved. A subset of telencephalic mushroom spines contains the spine apparatus (SA), an enigmatic organelle composed of stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whose formation depends on the expression of the actin-bundling protein Synaptopodin. Allocation of Synaptopodin to spines appears governed by cell-intrinsic mechanisms as the relative frequency of spines harboring Synaptopodin is conserved  and  Here we show that expression of Synaptopodin/SA in spines is required for induction of mGluR-LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of male mice. Post-mGluR-LTD, mushroom spines lacking Synaptopodin/SA are selectively lost, whereas spines harboring it are preserved. This process, dependent on activation of mGluR1 but not mGluR5, is conserved in mature mouse neurons and rat neurons of both sexes. Mechanistically, we find that mGluR1 supports physical retention of Synaptopodin within excitatory spine synapses during LTD while triggering lysosome-dependent degradation of the protein residing in dendritic shafts. Together, these results reveal a cellular mechanism, dependent on mGluR1, which enables selective preservation of stronger spines containing Synaptopodin/SA while eliminating weaker ones and potentially countering spurious strengthening by  recruitment of Synaptopodin. Overall, our results identify spines with Synaptopodin/SA as the locus of mGluR-LTD and underscore the importance of the molecular microanatomy of spines in synaptic plasticity. Long-term changes in functional synaptic strength are associated with modification of synaptic connectivity through stabilization or elimination of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic locus of excitatory synapses. How heterogeneous spine microanatomy instructs spine remodeling after long-term synaptic depression (LTD) remains unclear. Metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and mGluR5 induce a form of LTD critical to circuit function in physiological and disease conditions. Our results identify spines containing the protein Synaptopodin, which enables local assembly of a spine apparatus, as the locus of expression of mGluR-LTD and demonstrate a specific role of mGluR1 in promoting selective loss after mGluR-LTD of mature dendritic spines lacking Synaptopodin/spine apparatus.

We discovered that mGlu receptor activation facilitates long-term potentiation at synapses from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) onto somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) in mice. This plasticity appeared to be recruited during acute restraint stress, which induced intracellular calcium mobilization within SST-INs and rapidly potentiated postsynaptic strength onto SST-INs. Restraint stress and mGlu receptor activation each augmented BLA recruitment of SST-IN phasic feedforward inhibition, shunting information from other excitatory inputs, including the mediodorsal thalamus. Finally, studies using cell-type-specific mGlu receptor knockout mice revealed that mGlu receptor function in SST-expressing cells is necessary for restraint stress-induced changes to PFC physiology and related behaviors. These findings provide new insights into interneuron-specific synaptic plasticity mechanisms and suggest that SST-IN microcircuits may be promising targets for treating stress-induced psychiatric diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The hypocretins (Hcrts), also known as orexins, are two neuropeptides produced exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus. They act on two specific receptors that are widely distributed across the brain and involved in a myriad of neurophysiological functions that include sleep, arousal, feeding, reward, fear, anxiety and cognition. Hcrt cell loss in humans leads to narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy type 1), a disorder characterized by intrusions of sleep into wakefulness, demonstrating that the Hcrt system is nonredundant and essential for sleep/wake stability. The causal link between Hcrts and arousal/wakefulness stabilisation has led to the development of a new class of drugs, Hcrt receptor antagonists to treat insomnia, based on the assumption that blocking orexin-induced arousal will facilitate sleep. This has been clinically validated: currently, two Hcrt receptor antagonists are approved to treat insomnia (suvorexant and lemborexant), with a New Drug Application recently submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for a third drug (daridorexant). Other therapeutic applications under investigation include reduction of cravings in substance-use disorders and prevention of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, given the apparent bidirectional relationship between poor sleep and worsening of the disease. Circuit neuroscience findings suggest that the Hcrt system is a hub that integrates diverse inputs modulating arousal (e.g., circadian rhythms, metabolic status, positive and negative emotions) and conveys this information to multiple output regions. This neuronal architecture explains the wealth of physiological functions associated with Hcrts and highlights the potential of the Hcrt system as a therapeutic target for a number of disorders. We discuss present and future possible applications of drugs targeting the Hcrt system for the treatment of circuit-related neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To further advance functional MRI (fMRI)-based brain science, it is critical to dissect fMRI activity at the circuit level. To achieve this goal, we combined brain-wide fMRI with neuronal silencing in well-defined regions. Since focal inactivation suppresses excitatory output to downstream pathways, intact input and suppressed output circuits can be separated. Highly specific cerebral blood volume-weighted fMRI was performed with optogenetic stimulation of local GABAergic neurons in mouse somatosensory regions. Brain-wide spontaneous somatosensory networks were found mostly in ipsilateral cortical and subcortical areas, which differed from the bilateral homotopic connections commonly observed in resting-state fMRI data. The evoked fMRI responses to somatosensory stimulation in regions of the somatosensory network were successfully dissected, allowing the relative contributions of spinothalamic (ST), thalamocortical (TC), corticothalamic (CT), corticocortical (CC) inputs, and local intracortical circuits to be determined. The ventral posterior thalamic nucleus receives ST inputs, while the posterior medial thalamic nucleus receives CT inputs from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with TC inputs. The secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) receives mostly direct CC inputs from S1 and a few TC inputs from the ventral posterolateral nucleus. The TC and CC input layers in cortical regions were identified by laminar-specific fMRI responses with a full width at half maximum of <150 µm. Long-range synaptic inputs in cortical areas were amplified approximately twofold by local intracortical circuits, which is consistent with electrophysiological recordings. Overall, whole-brain fMRI with optogenetic inactivation revealed brain-wide, population-based, long-range circuits, which could complement data typically collected in conventional microscopic functional circuit studies.',\n",

We introduced a systematic stimulate and record protocol during which well-defined 4-node neural networks were stimulated electrically 4 times per second (4Hz) and their response was recorded over many days. We found that the network response pattern to a stimulus remained fairly stable for at least 12 h. Moreover, continuous stimulation over multiple weeks did not cause a significant change in the stimulation-induced mean spiking frequency of a circuit. We investigated the effect of stimulation amplitude and stimulation timing on the detailed network response. Finally, we could show that our setup can apply complex stimulation protocols with 125 different stimulation patterns.

       "  'abstract': 'Proper somatosensory circuit assembly is critical for processing somatosensory stimuli and for responding accordingly. In comparison to other sensory circuits (e.g., olfactory and visual), somatosensory circuits have unique anatomy and function. However, understanding of somatosensory circuit development lags far behind that of other sensory systems. For example, there are few identified transcription factors required for integration of interneurons into functional somatosensory circuits. Here, as a model, we examine one type of somatosensory interneuron, Even-skipped (Eve) expressing laterally placed interneurons (ELs) of the  larval nerve cord. Eve is a highly conserved, homeodomain transcription factor known to play a role in cell fate specification and neuronal axon guidance. Because marker genes are often functionally important in the cell types they define, we deleted  expression specifically from EL interneurons. On the cell biological level, using single neuron labeling, we find  plays several previously undescribed roles in refinement of neuron morphogenesis. Eve suppresses aberrant neurite branching, promotes axon elongation, and regulates dorsal-ventral dendrite position. On the circuit level, using optogenetics, calcium imaging, and behavioral analysis, we find  expression is required in EL interneurons for the normal encoding of somatosensory stimuli and for normal mapping of outputs to behavior. We conclude that the  gene product coordinately regulates multiple aspects of EL interneuron morphogenesis and is critically required to properly integrate EL interneurons into somatosensory circuits. Our data shed light on the genetic regulation of somatosensory circuit assembly.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Persistent improvement of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, is an unattained therapeutic objective. Gene therapy holds promise for treatment of familial and sporadic forms of AD. p38γ, a member of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, inhibits amyloid-β toxicity through regulation of tau phosphorylation. We recently showed that a gene delivery approach increasing p38γ resulted in markedly better learning and memory performance in mouse models of AD at advanced stages of amyloid-β- and tau-mediated cognitive impairment. Notably, low-to-moderate expression of p38γ had beneficial outcomes on cognition. The impact of high levels of p38γ on neuronal function remain unclear. Therefore, we addressed the outcomes of high levels of active p38γ on brain function, by direct injection of p38γ-encoding adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the forebrain of aged mice of an APP transgenic AD mouse model. While motor function in p38γ-expressing APP transgenic mice 2\\xa0months post-injection was comparable to control treated APP mice, their activity was markedly reduced in the open field test and included frequent bouts of immobility. Moreover, their learning and memory function was markedly impaired compared to control-treated aged APP mice. These results suggest that high neuronal levels of active p38γ emphasize a stress kinase role of p38γ, perturbing circuit function in motivation, navigation, and spatial learning. Overall, this work shows excessive neuronal p38γ levels can aggravate circuit dysfunction and advises adjustable expression systems will be required for sustainable AD gene therapy based on p38γ activity.\",\n",

However, there are times when it is important to combine some of these standpoints for getting a global picture, like for fully analyzing the morphological and topological features of a specific neuronal circuit. Within this framework, this article presents SynCoPa, a tool designed for bridging gaps among representations by providing techniques that allow combining detailed morphological neuron representations with the visualization of neuron interconnections at the synapse level. SynCoPa has been conceived for the interactive exploration and analysis of the connectivity elements and paths of simple to medium complexity neuronal circuits at the connectome level. This has been done by providing visual metaphors for synapses and interconnection paths, in combination with the representation of detailed neuron morphologies. SynCoPa could be helpful, for example, for establishing or confirming a hypothesis about the spatial distributions of synapses, or for answering questions about the way neurons establish connections or the relationships between connectivity and morphological features. Last, SynCoPa is easily extendable to include functional data provided, for example, by any of the morphologically-detailed simulators available nowadays, such as Neuron and Arbor, for providing a deep insight into the circuits features prior to simulating it, in particular any analysis where it is important to combine morphology, network topology, and physiology.',\n",

A logical extension of this idea is that forgetting occurs when engram cells cannot be reactivated. Forms of 'natural forgetting' vary considerably in terms of their underlying mechanisms, time course and reversibility. However, we suggest that all forms of forgetting involve circuit remodelling that switches engram cells from an accessible state (where they can be reactivated by natural recall cues) to an inaccessible state (where they cannot). In many cases, forgetting rates are modulated by environmental conditions and we therefore propose that forgetting is a form of neuroplasticity that alters engram cell accessibility in a manner that is sensitive to mismatches between expectations and the environment. Moreover, we hypothesize that disease states associated with forgetting may hijack natural forgetting mechanisms, resulting in reduced engram cell accessibility and memory loss.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an efficacious treatment option for an increasing range of brain disorders. To enhance our knowledge about the mechanisms of action of DBS and to probe novel targets, basic research in animal models with DBS is an essential research base. Beyond nonhuman primate, pig, and mouse models, the rat is a widely used animal model for probing DBS effects in basic research. Reconstructing DBS electrode placement after surgery is crucial to associate observed effects with modulating a specific target structure. Post-mortem histology is a commonly used method for reconstructing the electrode location. In humans, however, neuroimaging-based electrode localizations have become established. For this reason, we adapt the open-source software pipeline Lead-DBS for DBS electrode localizations from humans to the rat model. We validate our localization results by inter-rater concordance and a comparison with the conventional histological method. Finally, using the open-source software pipeline OSS-DBS, we demonstrate the subject-specific simulation of the VTA and the activation of axon models aligned to pathways representing neuronal fibers, also known as the pathway activation model. Both activation models yield a characterization of the impact of DBS on the target area. Our results suggest that the proposed neuroimaging-based method can precisely localize DBS electrode placements that are essentially rater-independent and yield results comparable to the histological gold standard. The advantages of neuroimaging-based electrode localizations are the possibility of acquiring them in vivo and combining electrode reconstructions with advanced imaging metrics, such as those obtained from diffusion or functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This paper introduces a freely available open-source pipeline for DBS electrode reconstructions in rats. The presented initial validation results are promising.',\n",

We integrate human cellular, circuit, and gene expression data to generate detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression.

A significant reduction in pro-inflammatory markers,\\xa0Il2,\\xa0II6, and\\xa0Il1b,\\xa0was observed in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and prefrontal cortex following lithium treatment. mRNA expression studies of\\xa0Gfap and Pparg,\\xa0along with histopathological analysis, suggested reactive astrogliosis to be a major contributor of neuroinflammation in ovariectomized rats that was normalized following lithium treatment. Further, the treatment inhibited Gsk-3β activity and maintained the normal level of β-catenin, CREB, and BDNF. The results revealed a defensive role of lithium against ovariectomy-induced neurobehavioural impairments, thus suggesting it to be a potential therapeutic agent for managing postmenopausal neurological symptoms.',\n",

Current information is then incorporated into the related neural network to update previously stored memories. However, the neuronal mechanism underlying the impact of memories of prior experiences on current learning is not well understood.

Moreover, optogenetic silencing of the PPC ensemble immediately after retrieval dissociated the interaction without affecting individual memories stored in the hippocampus and amygdala.

       "  'abstract': 'Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) regulate the rewarding actions of nicotine contained in tobacco that establish and maintain the smoking habit. nAChRs also regulate the aversive properties of nicotine, sensitivity to which decreases tobacco use and protects against tobacco use disorder. These opposing behavioral actions of nicotine reflect nAChR expression in brain reward and aversion circuits. nAChRs containing 4 and 2 subunits are responsible for the high-affinity nicotine binding sites in the brain and are densely expressed by reward-relevant neurons, most notably dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area. High-affinity nAChRs can incorporate additional subunits, including 3, 6, or 5 subunits, with the resulting nAChR subtypes playing discrete and dissociable roles in the stimulatory actions of nicotine on brain dopamine transmission. nAChRs in brain dopamine circuits also participate in aversive reactions to nicotine and the negative affective state experienced during nicotine withdrawal. nAChRs containing 3 and 4 subunits are responsible for the low-affinity nicotine binding sites in the brain and are enriched in brain sites involved in aversion, including the medial habenula, interpeduncular nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract, brain sites in which 5 nAChR subunits are also expressed. These aversion-related brain sites regulate nicotine avoidance behaviors, and genetic variation that modifies the function of nAChRs in these sites increases vulnerability to tobacco dependence and smoking-related diseases. Here, we review the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms through which nicotine elicits reward and aversion and the adaptations in these processes that drive the development of nicotine dependence. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Tobacco use disorder in the form of habitual cigarette smoking or regular use of other tobacco-related products is a major cause of death and disease worldwide.

       "  'abstract': 'Hippocampal atrophy has been consistently reported in major depressive disorder with more recent focus on subfields. However, literature on hippocampal volume changes after antidepressant treatment has been limited. The first-line treatments for depression include antidepressant medication (ADM) or cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). To understand the differential effects of CBT and ADM on the hippocampus, we investigated the volume alterations of hippocampal subfields with treatment, outcome, and chronicity in treatment-naïve depression patients.  Treatment-naïve depressed patients from the PReDICT study were included in this analysis. A total of 172 patients who completed 12 weeks of randomized treatment with CBT ( = 45) or ADM ( = 127) were included for hippocampal subfield volume analysis. Forty healthy controls were also included for the baseline comparison. Freesurfer 6.0 was used to segment 26 hippocampal substructures and bilateral whole hippocampus from baseline and week 12 structural MRI scans. A generalized linear model with covariates of age and gender was used for group statistical tests. A linear mixed model for the repeated measures with covariates of age and gender was used to examine volumetric changes over time and the contributing effects of treatment type, outcome, and illness chronicity.  Of the 172 patients, 85 achieved remission (63/127 ADM, 22/45 CBT). MDD patients showed smaller baseline volumes than healthy controls in CA1, CA3, CA4, parasubiculum, GC-ML-DG, Hippocampal Amygdala Transition Area (HATA), and fimbria. Over 12 weeks of treatment, further declines in the volumes of CA1, fimbria, subiculum, and HATA were observed regardless of treatment type or outcome. CBT remitters, but not ADM remitters, showed volume reduction in the right hippocampal tail. Unlike ADM remitters, ADM non-responders had a decline in volume in the bilateral hippocampal tails. Baseline volume of left presubiculum (regardless of treatment type) and right fimbria and HATA in CBT patients were correlated with a continuous measure of clinical improvement. Chronicity of depression had no effect on any measures of hippocampal subfield volumes.  Two first-line antidepressant treatments, CBT and ADM, have different effects on hippocampal tail after 12 weeks. This finding suggests that remission achieved via ADM may protect against progressive hippocampal atrophy by altering neuronal plasticity or supporting neurogenesis. Studies with multimodal neuroimaging, including functional and structural analysis, are needed to assess further the impact of two different antidepressant treatments on hippocampal subfields.',\n",

In this study, we expanded the understanding of peptides in this clade, using three species with well-studied nervous systems, , , and . For each species, we performed sequence homology analysis of  transcriptome predictions to identify homologs to 34 of 36 prohormones previously characterized in the gastropods  and . We then used single-cell mass spectrometry to characterize peptide profiles in homologous feeding interneurons: the multifunctional ventral white cell (VWC) in  and the small cardioactive peptide B large buccal (SLB) cells in  and . The neurons produced overlapping, but not identical, peptide profiles. The  SLB cells expressed peptides from homologs to the FMRFamide (FMRFa), small cardioactive peptide (SCP), LFRFamide (LFRFa), and feeding circuit activating peptides prohormones. The  SLB cells expressed peptides from homologs to the FMRFa, SCP, LFRFa, and MIP-related peptides prohormones. The VWC, previously shown to express peptides from the FMRFa and QNFLa (a homolog of  pedal peptide 4) prohormones, was shown to also contain SCP peptides. Thus, each neuron expressed peptides from the FMRFa and SCP families, the  and  SLB cells expressed peptides from the LFRFa family, and each neuron contained peptides from a prohormone not found in the others. These data suggest each neuron performs complex co-transmission, which potentially facilitates a multifunctional role in feeding. Additionally, the unique feeding characteristics of each species may relate, in part, to differences in the peptide profiles of these neurons. These data add chemical insight to enhance our understanding of the neuronal basis of behavior in nudipleurans and other gastropods.',\n",

Neurobiological efforts to localize the hypophagic effects of GLP-1R agonists in the brain have mainly focused on the hypothalamus and hindbrain. In this study, we performed a deep anatomical and neurophysiological characterization of GLP-1Rs in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). At an mRNA level, we found that  is diffusely coexpressed in known CeA subpopulations like protein kinase c δ (), somatostatin (), or tachykinin2 (). At a cellular level, we used Cre mice and viral Cre-dependent tracing to map the anatomical positions of GLP-1R cells across the rostral-caudal axis of the CeA and in CeA subdivisions. We found that 1  cells are highly enriched in the medial subdivision of the CeA (CeM). Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that 1  neurons are characterized by the presence of I-like currents and resemble a low threshold bursting neuronal subtype in response to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current injections. We observed sex differences in the magnitude of I-like currents and membrane capacitance. At rest, we observed that nearly half of 1  neurons are spontaneously active. We observed that active and inactive neurons display significant differences in excitability even when normalized to an identical holding potential. Our data are the first to deeply characterize the pattern of  in the CeA and study the neurophysiological characteristics of CeA neurons expressing .

       "  'abstract': 'Synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling is essential for the maintenance of neurotransmission, with a number of neurodevelopmental disorders linked to defects in this process. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) encoded by the  gene. Hyperexcitability of neuronal circuits is a key feature of FXS, therefore we investigated whether SV recycling was affected by the absence of FMRP during increased neuronal activity. We revealed that primary neuronal cultures from male  knock-out (KO) rats display a specific defect in activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). ADBE is dominant during intense neuronal activity, and this defect resulted in an inability of  KO neurons to sustain SV recycling during trains of high-frequency stimulation. Using a molecular replacement strategy, we also revealed that a human FMRP mutant that cannot bind BK channels failed to correct ADBE dysfunction in KO neurons, however this dysfunction was corrected by BK channel agonists. Therefore, FMRP performs a key role in sustaining neurotransmitter release via selective control of ADBE, suggesting intervention via this endocytosis mode may correct the hyperexcitability observed in FXS. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), however whether its loss has a direct role in neurotransmitter release remains a matter of debate. We demonstrate that neurons lacking FMRP display a specific defect in a mechanism that sustains neurotransmitter release during intense neuronal firing, called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). This discovery provides key insights into mechanisms of brain communication that occur because of loss of FMRP function. Importantly it also reveals ADBE as a potential therapeutic target to correct the circuit hyperexcitability observed in FXS.',\n",

Studying these developmental processes in the human nervous system remains difficult because of limited access to tissue that can be maintained as functional over time in vitro. We have previously developed a method to convert human pluripotent stem cells into brain region-specific organoids that can be fused and integrated to form assembloids and study neuronal migration. In contrast to approaches that mix cell lineages in 2D cultures or engineer microchips, assembloids leverage self-organization to enable complex cell-cell interactions, circuit formation and maturation in long-term cultures. In this protocol, we describe approaches to model long-range neuronal connectivity in human brain assembloids. We present how to generate 3D spheroids resembling specific domains of the nervous system and then how to integrate them physically to allow axonal projections and synaptic assembly. In addition, we describe a series of assays including viral labeling and retrograde tracing, 3D live imaging of axon projection and optogenetics combined with calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings to probe and manipulate the circuits in assembloids. The assays take 3-4 months to complete and require expertise in stem cell culture, imaging and electrophysiology.

In the well-characterized feeding neural circuit of ,  and  appetitive OC increases neuronal excitability and electrical coupling among several neurons leading to an increase in expression of ingestive behavior. Here, we used the  analog of OC to investigate whether OC reduces the excitability of a neuron, B4, whose inhibitory connections decrease expression of ingestive behavior. We found OC decreased the excitability of B4. This change appeared intrinsic to B4 because it could be replicated with an analog of OC in isolated cultures of B4 neurons. In addition to changes in B4 excitability, OC decreased the strength of B4's inhibitory connection to a key decision-making neuron, B51. The OC-induced changes were specific without affecting the excitability of another neuron critical for feeding behavior, B8, or the B4-to-B8 inhibitory connection. A conductance-based circuit model indicated that reducing the B4-to-B51 synapse, or increasing B51 excitability, mediated the OC phenotype more effectively than did decreasing B4 excitability. We combined these modifications to examine whether they could act synergistically. Combinations including B51 synergistically enhanced feeding. Taken together, these results suggest modifications of diverse loci work synergistically to mediate OC and that some neurons are well suited to work synergistically with plasticity in other loci. The ways in which synergism of diverse plasticity loci mediate the change in motor patterns in operant conditioning (OC) are poorly understood. Here, we found that OC was in part mediated by decreasing the intrinsic excitability of a critical neuron of  feeding behavior, and specifically reducing the strength of one of its inhibitory connections that targets a key decision-making neuron. A conductance-based computational model indicated that the known plasticity loci showed a surprising level of synergism to mediate the behavioral changes associated with OC. These results highlight the importance of understanding the diversity, specificity and synergy among different types of plasticity that encode memory. Also, because OC in  is mediated by dopamine (DA), the present study provides insights into specific and synergistic mechanisms of DA-mediated reinforcement of behaviors.\",\n",

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other neurological disorders are commonly associated with cognitive deficits and hippocampal dysfunction. Although there are many existing models of individual subregions of the hippocampus, few models attempt to integrate the primary areas into one system. In this work, we developed a computational model of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1. The subregions are represented as an interconnected neuronal network, incorporating well-characterized ex vivo slice electrophysiology into the functional neuron models and well-documented anatomical connections into the network structure. In addition, since plasticity is foundational to the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory as well as necessary for studying adaptation to injury, we implemented spike-timing-dependent plasticity among the synaptic connections. Our model mimics key features of hippocampal activity, including signal frequencies in the theta and gamma bands and phase-amplitude coupling in area CA1. We also studied the effects of spike-timing-dependent plasticity impairment, a potential consequence of TBI, in our model and found that impairment decreases broadband power in CA3 and CA1 and reduces phase coherence between these two subregions, yet phase-amplitude coupling in CA1 remains intact. Altogether, our work demonstrates characteristic hippocampal activity with a scaled network model of spiking neurons and reveals the sensitive balance of plasticity mechanisms in the circuit through one manifestation of mild traumatic injury.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Environmental enrichment induces behavioral and structural modifications in rodents and influences the capability of mice to cope with stress. However, little is understood about hippocampal neurogenesis and the appearance of social/agonistic (aggressive) behavior upon activation of different neuronal circuits in FVB/N mice. Thus, in this study we hypothesized that environmental enrichment differentially regulates neurogenesis, neural circuit activation and social/agonistic behavior in male and female FVB/N mice. We explored the (1) neurogenic process as an indicative of neuroplasticity, (2) neuronal activation in the limbic system, and (3) social behavior using the resident-intruder test. On postnatal day 23 (PD23), mice were assigned to one of two groups: Standard Housing or Environmental Enrichment. At PD53, rodents underwent the resident-intruder test to evaluate social behaviors. Results revealed that environmental enrichment increased neurogenesis and social interaction in females. In males, environmental enrichment increased neurogenesis and agonistic behavior. Enriched male mice expressed higher levels of agonistic-related behavior than female mice housed under the same conditions. Neural circuit analysis showed lower activation in the amygdala of enriched males and higher activation in enriched females than their respective controls. Enriched females also showed higher activation in the frontal cortex without differences in male groups. Moreover, the insular cortex was less activated in females than in males. Thus, our results indicate that environmental enrichment has different effects on neuroplasticity and social/agonistic behavior in FVB/N mice, suggesting the relevance of sexual dimorphism in response to environmental stimuli.',\n",

They show a higher conditioned response learning rate and earlier peak latency of the conditioned response signal. The neuronal mechanisms underlying this autistic behavioral phenotype are still unclear. Here, we use a physiologically constrained spiking neuron model of the cerebellar-cortical system to investigate which features are critical to explaining atypical learning in ASD. Significantly, the computer simulations run with the model suggest that the higher conditioned responses learning rate mainly depends on the reduced number of Purkinje cells. In contrast, the earlier peak latency mainly depends on the hyper-connections of the cerebellum with sensory and motor cortex. Notably, the model has been validated by reproducing the behavioral data collected from studies with real children. Overall, this article is a starting point to understanding the link between the behavioral and neurobiological basis in ASD learning.

In this study, we used recently developed progress in robust sparse labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography imaging system (fMOST) to label mediodorsal thalamus-projecting neurons in the VP and obtain high-resolution whole-brain imaging data. Based on these data, we reconstructed VP neurons and classified them into three types according to their fiber projection patterns. We systematically compared the axonal density in various downstream centers and analyzed the soma distribution and dendritic morphologies of the various subtypes at the single neuron level.

       "  'abstract': 'Dendritic spines, the distinctive postsynaptic feature of central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, have been studied extensively as electrical and chemical compartments, as well as scaffolds for receptor cycling and positioning of signaling molecules. The dynamics of the shape, number, and molecular composition of spines, and how they are regulated by neural activity, are critically important in synaptic efficacy, synaptic plasticity, and ultimately learning and memory. Dendritic spines originate as outward protrusions of the cell membrane, but this aspect of spine formation and stabilization has not been a major focus of investigation compared to studies of membrane protrusions in non-neuronal cells. We review here one family of proteins involved in membrane curvature at synapses, the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain proteins. The subfamily of inverse BAR (I-BAR) proteins sense and introduce outward membrane curvature, and serve as bridges between the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton. We focus on three I-BAR domain proteins that are expressed in the central nervous system: Mtss2, MIM, and IRSp53 that promote negative, concave curvature based on their ability to self-associate. Recent studies suggest that each has distinct functions in synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. The action of I-BARs is also shaped by crosstalk with other signaling components, forming signaling platforms that can function in a circuit-dependent manner. We discuss another potentially important feature-the ability of some BAR domain proteins to impact the function of other family members by heterooligomerization. Understanding the spatiotemporal resolution of synaptic I-BAR protein expression and their interactions should provide insights into the interplay between activity-dependent neural plasticity and network rewiring in the CNS.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer's disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS) represents a pathophysiology and diagnostic challenge. Although the diverse etiologies likely share a common mechanism to generate ocular, trunk, and limb movements, the underlying cause may be a paraneoplastic syndrome, as the first sign of cancer, or may be a postinfectious complication, and thus, the outcome depends on identifying the trigger mechanism. A recent hypothesis suggests increased GABAA receptor sensitivity in the olivary-oculomotor vermis-fastigial nucleus-premotor saccade burst neuron circuit in the brainstem. Therefore, OMAS management will focus on immunosuppression and modulation of GABAA hypersensitivity with benzodiazepines. We serially video recorded the eye movements at the bedside of 1 patient with SARS-CoV-2-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) serum antibodies, but twice-negative nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We tested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and nasopharyngeal samples. After brain MRI and chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans, we treated our patient with clonazepam and high-dose Solu-MEDROL, followed by a rituximab infusion after her formal eye movement analysis 10 days later. The recordings throughout her acute illness demonstrated different eye movement abnormalities. While on high-dose steroids and clonazepam, she initially had macrosaccadic oscillations, followed by brief ocular flutter during convergence the next day; after 10 days, she had bursts of opsoclonus during scotopic conditions with fixation block but otherwise normal eye movements. Concern for a suboptimal response to high-dose Solu-MEDROL motivated an infusion of rituximab, which induced remission. An investigation for a paraneoplastic etiology was negative. CSF testing showed elevated neuron-specific enolase. Serum IgG to Serum SARS-CoV2 IgG was elevated with negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal testing. A recent simulation model of macrosaccadic oscillations and OMAS proposes a combined pathology of brainstem and cerebellar because of increased GABAA receptor sensitivity. In this case report, we report 1 patient with elevated CSF neuronal specific enolase, macrosaccadic oscillations, ocular flutter, and OMAS as a SARS-CoV-2 postinfectious complication. Opsoclonus emerged predominantly with fixation block and suppressed with fixation, providing support to modern theories on the mechanism responsible for these ocular oscillations involving cerebellar-brainstem pathogenesis.

Post-mortem autoptic analysis shows the presence of amyloid β deposits, neuroinflammation and severe brain atrophy. However, brain circuit alterations and cellular derailments, assessed in very early stages of AD, still remain elusive. The understanding of these early alterations is crucial to tackle defective mechanisms. In a previous study we proved that the Tg2576 mouse model of AD displays functional deficits in the dorsal hippocampus and relevant behavioural AD-related alterations. We had shown that these deficits in Tg2576 mice correlate with the precocious degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and can be restored by L-DOPA treatment. Due to the distinct functionality and connectivity of dorsal versus ventral hippocampus, here we investigated neuronal excitability and synaptic functionality in the ventral CA1 hippocampal sub-region of Tg2576 mice. We found an age-dependent alteration of cell excitability and firing in pyramidal neurons starting at 3\\xa0months of age, that correlates with reduced levels in the ventral CA1 of tyrosine hydroxylase - the rate-limiting enzyme of DA synthesis. Additionally, at odds with the dorsal hippocampus, we found no alterations in basal glutamatergic transmission and long-term plasticity of ventral neurons in 8-month old Tg2576 mice compared to age-matched controls. Last, we used computational analysis to model the early derailments of firing properties observed and hypothesize that the neuronal alterations found could depend on dysfunctional sodium and potassium conductances, leading to anticipated depolarization-block of action potential firing. The present study depicts that impairment of cell excitability and homeostatic control of firing in ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons is a prodromal feature in Tg2576 AD mice.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Collagen VI is a key component of muscle basement membranes, and genetic variants can cause monogenic muscular dystrophies. Conversely, human genetic studies recently implicated collagen VI in central nervous system function, with variants causing the movement disorder dystonia. To elucidate the neurophysiological role of collagen VI, we generated mice with a truncation of the dystonia-related collagen α3 VI (COL6A3) C-terminal domain (CTD). These   mice showed a recessive dystonia-like phenotype in both sexes. We found that COL6A3 interacts with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) complex in a CTD-dependent manner.   mice of both sexes have impaired homeostasis of excitatory input to the basal pontine nuclei (BPN), a motor control hub with dense COL6A3 expression, consistent with deficient endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling. Aberrant synaptic input in the BPN was normalized by a CB1R agonist, and motor performance in   mice of both sexes was improved by CB1R agonist treatment. Our findings identify a readily therapeutically addressable synaptic mechanism for motor control. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements. We previously identified genetic variants affecting a specific domain of the COL6A3 protein as a cause of dystonia. Here, we created mice lacking the affected domain and observed an analogous movement disorder. Using a protein interaction screen, we found that the affected COL6A3 domain mediates an interaction with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R). Concordantly, our COL6A3-deficient mice showed a deficit in synaptic plasticity linked to a deficit in cannabinoid signaling. Pharmacological cannabinoid augmentation rescued the motor impairment of the mice. Thus, cannabinoid augmentation could be a promising avenue for treating dystonia, and we have identified a possible molecular mechanism mediating this.',\n",

The Kenyon cells (KCs) of the  adult mushroom body (MB) respond sparsely to complex olfactory input, a property that is thought to support stimuli discrimination in the MB. To understand how this property emerges, we investigated the role of the inhibitory anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron in the input circuit of the MB, the calyx. Within the calyx, presynaptic boutons of projection neurons (PNs) form large synaptic microglomeruli (MGs) with dendrites of postsynaptic KCs. Combining electron microscopy (EM) data analysis and in vivo calcium imaging, we show that APL, via inhibitory and reciprocal synapses targeting both PN boutons and KC dendrites, normalizes odour-evoked representations in MGs of the calyx. APL response scales with the PN input strength and is regionalized around PN input distribution. Our data indicate that the formation of a sparse code by the KCs requires APL-driven normalization of their MG postsynaptic responses. This work provides experimental insights on how inhibition shapes sensory information representation in a higher brain centre, thereby supporting stimuli discrimination and allowing for efficient associative memory formation.',\n",

However, neural mechanisms integrating multiple sensory cues and regulating motivation for sexual behaviors remain unclear. Here, we focused on peptidergic neurons, terminal nerve gonadotropin-releasing hormone (TN-GnRH) neurons, which receive inputs from various sensory systems and co-express neuropeptide FF (NPFF) in addition to GnRH. Our behavioral analyses using knockout medaka of GnRH (gnrh3) and/or NPFF (npff) demonstrated that some sexual behavioral repertoires were delayed, not disrupted, in gnrh3 and npff single knockout males, while the double knockout appeared to alleviate the significant defects that were observed in single knockouts. We also found anatomical evidence to show that both neuropeptides modulate the sexual behavior-controlling brain areas. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NPFF activates neurons in the preoptic area via indirect pathway, which is considered to induce the increase in motivation for male sexual behaviors. Considering these results, we propose a novel mechanism by which co-existing peptides of the TN-GnRH neurons, NPFF, and GnRH3 coordinately modulate certain neuronal circuit for the control of behavioral motivation. Our results may go a long way toward understanding the functional significance of peptidergic neuromodulation in response to sensory information from the external environments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One of the biggest mysteries in neurobiology concerns the mechanisms responsible for the diversification of the brain over different time scales, i.e. during development and evolution. Subtle differences in the timing of biological processes during development, e.g. onset, offset, duration, speed and sequence, can trigger large changes in phenotypic outcomes. At the level of a single organism, altered timing of developmental events can lead to individual variability, as well as malformation and disease. At the level of phylogeny, there are known interspecies differences in the timing of developmental events, and this is thought to be an important factor that drives phenotypic variation across evolution, known as heterochrony. A particularly striking example of phenotypic variation is the evolution of human cognitive abilities, which has largely been attributed to the development of the mammalian-specific neocortex and its subsequent expansion in higher primates. Here, I review how the timing of different aspects of cortical development specifies developmental outcomes within species, including processes of cell proliferation and differentiation, neuronal migration and lamination, and axonal targeting and circuit maturation.

Yet little is known of the molecular mechanisms that control the establishment of astrocyte morphology and the bi-directional communication between astrocytes and neurons. Here we show that neuronal contact stimulates expression of S1PR1, the receptor for the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), on perisynaptic astrocyte processes and that S1PR1 drives astrocyte morphological complexity and morphogenesis. Moreover, the S1P/S1PR1 axis increases neuronal contact-induced expression of astrocyte secreted synaptogenic factors SPARCL1 and thrombospondin 4 that are involved in neural circuit assembly.

Multicolor imaging is particularly powerful for circuit tracing with fluorescence microscopy. However, multicolor imaging of large samples often suffers from chromatic aberration, where different excitation wavelengths of light have different focal points. In this study, we evaluated chromatic aberrations for representative objective lenses and a clearing agent with confocal microscopy and found that axial aberration is particularly problematic. Moreover, the axial chromatic aberrations were often depth-dependent. Therefore, we developed a program that is able to align depths for different fluorescence channels based on reference samples with fluorescent beads or data from guide stars within biological samples. We showed that this correction program can successfully correct chromatic aberrations found in confocal images of multicolor-labeled brain tissues. Our simple  correction strategy is useful to obtain large-scale multicolor images of cleared tissues with minimal chromatic aberrations.',\n",

After such \"kindling\" process, a moderate stimulus would become sufficient in triggering a severe seizure. Here, we report that optogenetic neuronal stimulation can also convert the rat brain to a hyperexcitable state. However, continued stimulation once again converted the brain to a state that was strongly resistant to seizure induction. Histochemical examinations showed that moderate astrocyte activation was coincident with resilience acquisition. Administration of an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist instantly reverted the brain back to a hyperexcitable state, suggesting that hyperexcitability was suppressed by adenosine. Furthermore, an increase in basal adenosine was confirmed using in vivo microdialysis. Daily neuron-to-astrocyte signaling likely prompted a homeostatic increase in the endogenous actions of adenosine.

The extended amygdala (AMY) is a complex circuit involved in both stress- and ethanol-related responses. We hypothesized that MS stress may increase ethanol consumption in adulthood, as well as augment neuronal activity in extended AMY, in a sex-dependent manner. We aimed to investigate the influence of MS stress on the ethanol consumption of male and female mice, and the involvement of extended amygdala sub-nuclei in this process. The C57BL/6J pups were subjected to 180min of MS, from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 14. The control group was left undisturbed. On PND 45, mice (=28) in cages were exposed to a bottle containing 20% ethanol (w/v) for 4h during the dark period of the light-dark cycle, for 3weeks. Afterward, mice underwent ethanol self-administration training in operant chambers under fixed ratio (FR) schedule. Then, subjects were tested under 2h sessions of a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement (the last ratio achieved was considered the breaking point), and at the end, a 4h session of FR schedule (binge-intake). An immunohistochemistry assay for Fos protein was performed in Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis (BNST), and AMY. Our results showed that in the third week of training, the female MS group consumed more ethanol than the respective control group. The MS group presented increased breakpoint parameters. Female control group and male MS group were more resistant to bitter quinine taste. Increased Fos-immunoreactive neurons (Fos-IR) were observed in the central nucleus of AMY, but not in NAcc nor BNST in male maternal-separated mice.

       "  'abstract': 'Voltage-gated Na (Na) channels are the primary molecular determinant of the action potential. Among the nine isoforms of the Na channel α subunit that have been described (Na1.1-Na1.9), Na1.1, Na1.2, and Na1.6 are the primary isoforms expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Crucially, these three CNS Na channel isoforms display differential expression across neuronal cell types and diverge with respect to their subcellular distributions. Considering these differences in terms of their localization, the CNS Na channel isoforms could represent promising targets for the development of targeted neuromodulators. However, current therapeutics that target Na channels lack selectivity, which results in deleterious side effects due to modulation of off-target Na channel isoforms. Among the structural components of the Na channel α subunit that could be pharmacologically targeted to achieve isoform selectivity, the C-terminal domains (CTD) of Na channels represent promising candidates on account of displaying appreciable amino acid sequence divergence that enables functionally unique protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with Na channel auxiliary proteins. In medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical brain region of the mesocorticolimbic circuit, the PPI between the CTD of the Na1.6 channel and its auxiliary protein fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) is central to the generation of electrical outputs, underscoring its potential value as a site for targeted neuromodulation. Focusing on this PPI, we previously developed a peptidomimetic derived from residues of FGF14 that have an interaction site on the CTD of the Na1.6 channel. In this work, we show that whereas the compound displays dose-dependent effects on the activity of Na1.6 channels in heterologous cells, the compound does not affect Na1.1 or Na1.2 channels at comparable concentrations. In addition, we show that the compound correspondingly modulates the action potential discharge and the transient Na+ of MSNs of the NAc. Overall, these results demonstrate that pharmacologically targeting the FGF14 interaction site on the CTD of the Na1.6 channel is a strategy to achieve isoform-selective modulation, and, more broadly, that sites on the CTDs of Na channels interacted with by auxiliary proteins could represent candidates for the development of targeted therapeutics.',\n",

The aim of this work is to review earlier studies showing that NO plays a role in erectile function and sexual behavior in the hypothalamus and its paraventricular nucleus and the medial preoptic area, and integrate these findings with those of recent studies on this matter. This revisitation shows that NO influences erectile function and sexual behavior in males and females by acting not only in the paraventricular nucleus and medial preoptic area but also in extrahypothalamic brain areas, often with different mechanisms. Most importantly, since these areas are strictly interconnected with the paraventricular nucleus and medial preoptic area, send to and receive neural projections from the spinal cord, in which sexual communication between brain and genital apparatus takes place, this review reveals that central NO participates in concert with neurotransmitters/neuropeptides to a neural circuit controlling both the consummatory (penile erection, copulation, lordosis) and appetitive components (sexual motivation, arousal, reward) of sexual behavior.',\n",

Following an acute excitotoxic insult, inhibitory synapses are eliminated, reducing synaptic inhibition, elevating circuit excitability, and contributing to the pathophysiology of brain injuries. However, mechanisms that drive inhibitory synapse disassembly and elimination are undefined. We find that inhibitory synapses are disassembled in a sequential manner following excitotoxicity: GABARs undergo rapid nanoscale rearrangement and are dispersed from the synapse along with presynaptic active zone components, followed by the gradual removal of the gephyrin scaffold, prior to complete elimination of the presynaptic terminal. GABAR nanoscale reorganization and synaptic declustering depends on calcineurin signaling, whereas disassembly of gephyrin relies on calpain activation, and blockade of both enzymes preserves inhibitory synapses after excitotoxic insult. Thus, inhibitory synapse disassembly occurs rapidly, with nanoscale precision, in a stepwise manner and most likely represents a critical step in the progression of hyperexcitability following excitotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-like (Nedd4-2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for neurodevelopment and homeostasis of neural circuit excitability. While dysregulation of Nedd4-2 has been linked to elevated seizure susceptibility through impaired ubiquitination of multiple direct substrates, it remains largely unclear whether Nedd4-2 interconnects other cellular pathways that affect neuronal activity and seizure susceptibility. Here, we first showed that Nedd4-2 associates with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and regulates the expression of multiple ER-resident proteins. Furthermore, utilizing Nedd4-2 conditional knockout mice, we showed that Nedd4-2 is required for the maintenance of spontaneous neural activity and excitatory synapses following the induction of ER stress. When analyzing activation of the canonical pathways of ER stress response, we found that Nedd4-2 is required for phosphorylation of eIF2α. While phosphorylation of eIF2α has been shown to reduce seizure susceptibility, attempts to facilitate phosphorylation of eIF2α in Nedd4-2 conditional knockout mice failed to produce such a beneficial function, suggesting a role for Nedd4-2 in integrating the ER stress response to modulate seizure susceptibility. Altogether, our study demonstrates neuroprotective functions of Nedd4-2 during ER stress in neurons and could provide insight into neurological diseases in which the expression or activity of Nedd4-2 is impaired.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Disruptions in the delivery of oxygen and glucose impair the function of neural circuits, with lethal consequences commonly observed in stroke and cardiac arrest. Intense focus has been placed on understanding how to overcome neuronal failure during energy stress. Important insights into neuroprotective strategies have come from studies of evolutionary adaptations for survival in hypoxic environments, such as those seen in turtles, naked mole-rats, and several other animals. Amphibians are not usually numbered among 'champion' hypoxia-tolerant vertebrates, yet here we demonstrate a massive increase in the capacity of a neural circuit to produce activity following oxygen and glucose deprivation in adult bullfrogs. Rhythmic output from a brainstem circuit failed following minutes of severe hypoxia and simulated ischemia; however, after hibernation this network produced patterned activity for ∼3.5 hours during severe hypoxia and ∼2 hours in ischemia. This remarkable improvement was supported by a switch to brain glycogen to fuel anaerobic glycolysis, a pathway thought to support neuronal homeostasis for only a few minutes during ischemia. These results reveal that circuit activity can exhibit dramatic metabolic plasticity that minimizes the need for ATP synthesis, and these findings represent the greatest range in hypoxia tolerance within a vertebrate neural network. Uncovering the rules that allow the brain to flexibly run only on endogenous fuel reserves will reveal new insights into brain energetics, circuit evolution, and neuroprotection.\",\n",

Sema3F and its receptor neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) have been shown to be involved in the stereotyped pruning of the infrapyramidal bundle (IPB) of mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the developing hippocampus. Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) were originally identified as an intracellular mediator of semaphorin signaling, and the defective pruning of IPB was recently reported in CRMP2-/- and CRMP3-/- mice. CRMP1 and CRMP4 have high homology to CRMP2 and CRMP3, and their expression in the developing mouse brain overlaps; however, their role in IPB pruning has not yet been examined. In this study, we report that CRMP4, but not CRMP1, is involved in IPB pruning during neural circuit formation in the hippocampus. Our genetic interaction analyses indicated that CRMP2 and CRMP4 have distinct functions and that CRMP2 mediates IPB pruning via Nrp2. We also observed the altered synaptic terminals of mossy fibers in CRMP2 and CRMP4 mutant mice. These results suggest that CRMP family members have a distinct function in the axon pruning and targeting of mossy fibers of the hippocampal DG in the developing mouse brain.',\n",

Neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that are activated by emotional information may be one of the key mechanisms underlying this destabilization. However, the specific neural circuits underlying this destabilization process remain unknown. Because BLA receives noradrenergic inputs from the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and locus coeruleus (LC), we studied the role of afferent projections into the BLA in the destabilization of morphine self-administration memory in rats. We first showed that morphine (unconditioned stimulus, US)\\xa0+\\xa0morphine-associated conditioned stimuli (CS) exposure, rather than CS exposure alone, destabilized morphine self-administration memory. Then, we measured projection-specific activation after the US\\xa0+\\xa0CS or CS retrieval test using c-fos (activity marker)-labeling in projection areas. Compared with CS exposure, we found that US\\xa0+\\xa0CS exposure induced more neuronal activation in the BLA and NTS but not in the LC. Next, we determined the effects of chemogenetic inactivation or activation of NTS or LC projections to BLA (NTS\\xa0→\\xa0BLA or LC\\xa0→\\xa0BLA) on this destabilization. We found that NTS\\xa0→\\xa0BLA, but not LC\\xa0→\\xa0BLA inactivation during memory retrieval, prevented memory destabilization induced by US\\xa0+\\xa0CS exposure.

       "  'abstract': \"Epileptogenesis is the particular process during which the epileptic network builds up progressively before the onset of the first seizures. Whether physiological functions are impacted by this development of epilepsy remains unclear. To explore this question, we used Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg (GAERS), in which spike-and-wave discharges are initiated in the whisker primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) and first occur during cortical maturation. We studied the development of both the epileptic and the physiological wS1 circuits during cortical maturation to understand the interactions between them and the consequences for the animals' behavior. In sedated and immobilized rat pups, we recorded in vivo epileptic and whisker sensory evoked activities across the wS1 and thalamus using multicontact electrodes. We compared sensory evoked potentials based on current source density analysis. We then analyzed the multiunit activities evoked by whisker stimulation in GAERS and control rats. Finally, we evaluated behavioral performance dependent on the functionality of the wS1 cortex using the gap-crossing task. We showed that the epileptic circuit changed during the epileptogenesis period in GAERS, by involving different cortical layers of wS1. Neuronal activities evoked by whisker stimulation were reduced in the wS1 cortex at P15 and P30 in GAERS but increased in the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus at P15 and in the posterior medial nucleus at P30, when compared to control rats. Finally, we observed lower performance in GAERS versus controls, at both P15 and P30, in a whisker-mediated behavioral task. Our data show that the functionality of wS1 cortex and thalamus is altered early during absence epileptogenesis in GAERS and then evolves before spike-and-wave discharges are fully expressed. They suggest that the development of the pathological circuit disturbs the physiological one and may be responsible for both the emergence of seizures and associated comorbidities. \",\n",

Accordingly, the expression of proteins and specific protein isoforms that contribute to these processes must be controlled quantitatively in time and space. A wide variety of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, which act on pre-mRNA and mRNA molecules contribute to this control. They are thereby critically involved in physiological and pathophysiological nervous system development, function, and maintenance. Here, we review recent findings on how mRNA metabolism contributes to neuronal development, from neural stem cell maintenance to synapse specification, with a particular focus on axon growth, guidance, branching, and synapse formation. We emphasize the role of RNA-binding proteins, and highlight their emerging roles in the poorly understood molecular processes of RNA editing, alternative polyadenylation, and temporal control of splicing, while also discussing alternative splicing, RNA localization, and local translation. We illustrate with the example of the evolutionary conserved Musashi protein family how individual RNA-binding proteins are, on the one hand, acting in different processes of RNA metabolism, and, on the other hand, impacting multiple steps in neuronal development and circuit formation.

A recently described regulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to the NAcSh (DRN\\u2009→\\u2009NAcSh) is the neuropeptide neuromedin U (NMU). Here, we find that systemic administration of NMU decreases breakpoint for cocaine on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement in male rats. Employing a retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV), we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the NMU receptor 2 (NMUR2) in afferent DRN projections to the NAcSh increases the breakpoint for cocaine. Our previous studies demonstrated that NMU regulates GABA release in the NAcSh, and our current investigation found that systemic NMU administration suppresses cocaine-evoked GABA release in the NAcSh and increases phosphorylated c-Fos expression in neurons projecting from the NAcSh to the ventral pallidum (VP). To further probe the impact of NMU/NMUR2 on neuroanatomical pathways regulating motivation for cocaine, we employed multi-viral transsynaptic studies. Using a combination of rabies virus and retrograde AAV helper virus, we mapped the impact of NMU across three distinct brain regions simultaneously and found a direct connection of GABAergic DRN neurons to the NAcSh\\u2009→\\u2009VP pathway. Together, these data reveal that NMU/NMUR2 modulates a direct connection within the GABAergic DRN\\u2009→\\u2009NAcSh\\u2009→\\u2009VP circuit that diminishes breakpoints for cocaine. These findings importantly advance our understanding of the neurochemical underpinnings of pathway-specific regulation of neurocircuitry that may regulate cocaine self-administration, providing a unique therapeutic perspective.',\n",

Previously, we had reported a predominant expression of ChT in memory processing and storing region of the Drosophila brain called mushroom bodies (MBs). It is unknown how ChT contributes to the functional principles of MB operation. Here, we demonstrate the role of ChT in Habituation, a non-associative form of learning. Odour driven habituation traces are laid down in ChT dependent manner in antennal lobes (AL), projection neurons (PNs), and MBs. We observed that reduced habituation due to knock-down of ChT in MBs causes hypersensitivity towards odour, suggesting that ChT also regulates incoming stimulus suppression. Importantly, we show for the first time that ChT is not unique to cholinergic neurons but is also required in inhibitory GABAergic neurons to drive habituation behaviour. Our results support a model in which ChT regulates both habituation and incoming stimuli through multiple circuit loci via an interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Strikingly, the lack of ChT in MBs shows characteristics similar to the major reported features of Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including attenuated habituation, sensory hypersensitivity as well as defective GABAergic signalling. Our data establish the role of ChT in habituation and suggest that its dysfunction may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders like ASD.',\n",

Androgen is the most important endocrine hormone in men, which is deeply involved in the whole process of male sexual response, but how it regulates male sexual arousal has not been fully clarified and remains one of the hotspots in current andrological research. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of the advances in the studies of the related role and mechanism of androgen in male sexual arousal. In the central nervous system, androgen regulates the release of dopamine neurotransmitters by binding androgen receptors or metabolizing neurosteroids, thus activating the brain reward system. Besides, androgen regulates the neuronal plasticity and spinous process formation in the neural circuit of sexual arousal to ensure successful activation and conduction of the neural circuit.

Here we show how the Drosophila central complex, a region implicated in goal-directed navigation, performs vector arithmetic. First, we describe a neural signal in the fan-shaped body that explicitly tracks the allocentric travelling angle of a fly, that is, the travelling angle in reference to external cues. Past work has identified neurons in Drosophila and mammals that track the heading angle of an animal referenced to external cues (for example, head direction cells), but this new signal illuminates how the sense of space is properly updated when travelling and heading angles differ (for example, when walking sideways). We then characterize a neuronal circuit that performs an egocentric-to-allocentric (that is, body-centred to world-centred) coordinate transformation and vector addition to compute the allocentric travelling direction. This circuit operates by mapping two-dimensional vectors onto sinusoidal patterns of activity across distinct neuronal populations, with the amplitude of the sinusoid representing the length of the vector and its phase representing the angle of the vector. The principles of this circuit may generalize to other brains\\xa0and to domains beyond navigation where vector operations or reference-frame transformations are required.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Offset responses in auditory processing appear after a sound terminates. They arise in neuronal circuits within the peripheral auditory system, but their role in the central auditory system remains unknown. Here, we ask what the behavioral relevance of cortical offset responses is and what circuit mechanisms drive them. At the perceptual level, our results reveal that experimentally minimizing auditory cortical offset responses decreases the mouse performance to detect sound termination, assigning a behavioral role to offset responses. By combining in vivo electrophysiology in the auditory cortex and thalamus of awake mice, we also demonstrate that cortical offset responses are not only inherited from the periphery but also amplified and generated de novo. Finally, we show that offset responses code more than silence, including relevant changes in sound trajectories. Together, our results reveal the importance of cortical offset responses in encoding sound termination and detecting changes within temporally discontinuous sounds crucial for speech and vocalization.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For the last two decades, pathogenic concepts in Parkinson disease (PD) have revolved around the toxicity and spread of α-synuclein. Thus, α-synuclein would follow caudo-rostral propagation from the periphery to the central nervous system, first producing non-motor manifestations (such as constipation, sleep disorders and hyposmia), and subsequently impinging upon the mesencephalon to account for the cardinal motor features before reaching the neocortex as the disease evolves towards dementia. This model is the prevailing theory of the principal neurobiological mechanism of disease. Here, we scrutinize the temporal evolution of motor and non-motor manifestations in PD and suggest that, even though the postulated bottom-up mechanisms are likely to be involved, early involvement of the nigrostriatal system is a key and prominent pathophysiological mechanism. Upcoming studies of detailed clinical manifestations with newer neuroimaging techniques will allow us to more closely define, in vivo, the role of α-synuclein aggregates with respect to neuronal loss during the onset and progression of PD.',\n",

Simulated nematode maze navigation during training conditions in food-baited mazes and during testing conditions in empty mazes is validated by comparing simulated behaviour with new experimental video data, extracted through the implementation of a custom-made maze tracking algorithm.

       "  'abstract': \"The striatum's complex microcircuit is made by connections within and between its D1- and D2-receptor expressing projection neurons and at least five species of interneuron. Precise knowledge of this circuit is likely essential to understanding striatum's functional roles and its dysfunction in a wide range of movement and cognitive disorders. We introduce here a Bayesian approach to mapping neuron connectivity using intracellular recording data, which lets us simultaneously evaluate the probability of connection between neuron types, the strength of evidence for it, and its dependence on distance. Using it to synthesize a complete map of the mouse striatum, we find strong evidence for two asymmetries: a selective asymmetry of projection neuron connections, with D2 neurons connecting twice as densely to other projection neurons than do D1 neurons, but neither subtype preferentially connecting to another; and a length-scale asymmetry, with interneuron connection probabilities remaining non-negligible at more than twice the distance of projection neuron connections. We further show that our Bayesian approach can evaluate evidence for wiring changes, using data from the developing striatum and a mouse model of Huntington's disease. By quantifying the uncertainty in our knowledge of the microcircuit, our approach reveals a wide range of potential striatal wiring diagrams consistent with current data. To properly understand a neuronal circuit's function, it is important to have an accurate picture of the rate of connection between individual neurons and how this rate changes with the distance separating pairs of neurons. We present a Bayesian method for extracting this information from experimental data and apply it to the mouse striatum, a subcortical structure involved in learning and decision-making, which is made up of a variety of different projection neurons and interneurons. Our resulting statistical map reveals not just the most robust estimates of the probability of connection between neuron types, but also the strength of evidence for them, and their dependence on distance.\",\n",

We addressed this issue in the hippocampus by performing combined optogenetic and pharmacogenetic local and upstream inactivation. Silencing the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) largely abolished extracellular theta and gamma currents in CA1 while only moderately affecting firing rates. In contrast, CA3 and local CA1 silencing strongly decreased firing of CA1 neurons without affecting theta currents. Each perturbation reconfigured the CA1 spatial map. However, the ability of the CA1 circuit to support place field activity persisted, maintaining the same fraction of spatially tuned place fields and reliable assembly expression as in the intact mouse. Thus, the CA1 network can induce and maintain coordinated cell assemblies with minimal reliance on its inputs, but these inputs can effectively reconfigure and assist in maintaining stability of the CA1 map.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuronal remodeling after brain injury is essential for functional recovery. After unilateral cortical lesion, axons from the intact cortex ectopically project to the denervated midbrain, but the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined gene expression profiles in denervated and intact mouse midbrains after hemispherectomy at early developmental stages using mice of either sex, when ectopic contralateral projection occurs robustly. The analysis showed that various axon growth-related genes were upregulated in the denervated midbrain, and most of these genes are reportedly expressed by glial cells. To identify the underlying molecules, the receptors for candidate upregulated molecules were knocked out in layer 5 projection neurons in the intact cortex, using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method, and axonal projection from the knocked-out cortical neurons was examined after hemispherectomy. We found that the ectopic projection was significantly reduced when integrin subunit β three or neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (also known as TrkB) was knocked out. Overall, the present study suggests that denervated midbrain-derived glial factors contribute to lesion-induced remodeling of the cortico-mesencephalic projection via these receptors. After brain injury, compensatory neural circuits are established that contribute to functional recovery. However, little is known about the intrinsic mechanism that underlies the injury-induced remodeling. We found that after unilateral cortical ablation expression of axon-growth promoting factors is elevated in the denervated midbrain and is involved in the formation of ectopic axonal projection from the intact cortex. Evidence further demonstrated that these factors are expressed by astrocytes and microglia, which are activated in the denervated midbrain. Thus, our present study provides a new insight into the mechanism of lesion-induced axonal remodeling and further therapeutic strategies after brain injury.',\n",

Few individuals with AUDs receive treatment and treatment options are complicated by issues with effectiveness and compliance. Alcohol has been shown to differentially affect specific brain regions and an improved understanding of circuit-specific dysregulation caused by alcohol is warranted. Previous work has implicated both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in alcohol-associated plasticity, however studies directly examining the impact of alcohol exposure on this circuit are lacking. The current study employed an optogenetic strategy to investigate the prelimbic mPFC to BLA circuit and changes in circuit activity following chronic intragastric ethanol exposure in male Sprague Dawley rats. We observed monosynaptic connections with light-evoked stimulation of mPFC terminals in the BLA with efficacy and short latency. We also found that mPFC-BLA projections are primarily glutamatergic under basal inhibitory control, with a lesser population of GABAergic projections. We examined optically-evoked glutamate currents in the BLA using repeated trains of stimulation that displayed accommodation, or a reduction in evoked current amplitude over repeated stimulations. We found that following chronic ethanol exposure mPFC-BLA glutamatergic connections were dysregulated such that there were decreases in overall function, notably in synaptic strength and accommodation, with no change in probability of evoked glutamate release. The lesser GABAergic component of the mPFC-BLA circuit was not altered by chronic ethanol exposure. Collectively these data indicate that mPFC-BLA circuitry is a significant target of alcohol-associated plasticity, which may contribute to pathological behavior associated with AUDs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Brain aging is associated with alterations in the behavioral capacity to process information, due to mechanisms that are still largely unclear. Short-term neuronal activity dynamics are basic properties of local brain networks profoundly involved in neural information processing. In this study, we investigated the properties of short-term changes in excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal excitation in the CA1 field of dorsal and ventral hippocampal slices from young adult and old rats. We found that short-term synaptic plasticity (i.e. short-term dynamics of input to CA1 circuit) does not significantly differ between young and old dorsal or ventral hippocampus. However, short-term dynamics of hippocampal output differ markedly between young and old rats. Notably, age-dependent alterations in short-term neuronal dynamics were detected mainly in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, the dorsal hippocampus of young rats can detect and facilitate transmission of 1-30 Hz input and depress transmission of higher-frequency input. In contrast, the old dorsal hippocampus appears unable to transmit information in a frequency-dependent discriminatory manner. Furthermore, the amplification of steady-state output at frequencies < 40 Hz is considerably lower in the old than the young dorsal hippocampus. The old ventral hippocampus did not show major alterations in short-term processing of neural information, though under conditions of intense afferent activation, neuronal output of the ventral hippocampus is depressed at steady-state more in old than in young rats. These results suggest that aging is accompanied by alterations in neural information processing mainly in the dorsal hippocampus, which displays a narrower dynamic range of frequency-dependent transient changes in neuronal activity in old compared with young adult rats. These alterations in short-term dynamics may relate to deficits in processing ongoing activity seen in old individuals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Systems memory consolidation involves the transfer of memories across brain regions and the transformation of memory content. For example, declarative memories that transiently depend on the hippocampal formation are transformed into long-term memory traces in neocortical networks, and procedural memories are transformed within cortico-striatal networks. These consolidation processes are thought to rely on replay and repetition of recently acquired memories, but the cellular and network mechanisms that mediate the changes of memories are poorly understood. Here, we suggest that systems memory consolidation could arise from Hebbian plasticity in networks with parallel synaptic pathways-two ubiquitous features of neural circuits in the brain. We explore this hypothesis in the context of hippocampus-dependent memories. Using computational models and mathematical analyses, we illustrate how memories are transferred across circuits and discuss why their representations could change. The analyses suggest that Hebbian plasticity mediates consolidation by transferring a linear approximation of a previously acquired memory into a parallel pathway. Our modelling results are further in quantitative agreement with lesion studies in rodents. Moreover, a hierarchical iteration of the mechanism yields power-law forgetting-as observed in psychophysical studies in humans. The predicted circuit mechanism thus bridges spatial scales from single cells to cortical areas and time scales from milliseconds to years.',\n",

Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic drug with a pronounced teratogenic effect associated with a high risk of ASD, and its administration to rats during the gestation is used for autism modeling. It has been hypothesized that valproate induced damage and functional alterations of autism target structures may occur and evolve during early postnatal life. Here, we used prenatal and postnatal administrations of VPA to investigate the main behavioral features which are associated with autism spectrum disorders core symptoms were tested in early juvenile and adult rats. Neuroanatomical lesion of autism target structures and electrophysiological studies in specific neural circuits. Our results showed that prenatal and early postnatal administration of valproate led to the behavioral alterations that were similar to ASD. Postnatally treated group showed tendency to normalize in adulthood. We found pronounced structural changes in the brain target regions of prenatally VPA-treated groups, and an absence of abnormalities in postnatally VPA-treated groups, which confirmed the different severity of VPA across different stages of brain development. The results of this study clearly show time dependent effect of VPA on neurodevelopment, which might be explained by temporal differences of brain regions' development process. Presumably, postnatal administration of valproate leads to the dysfunction of synaptic networks that is recovered during the lifespan, due to the brain plasticity and compensatory ability of circuit refinement. Therefore, investigations of compensatory homeostatic mechanisms activated after VPA administration and directed to eliminate the defects in postnatal brain, may elucidate strategies to improve the course of disease.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the brain and perform a wide range of tasks that support neuronal function and circuit activities. There is emerging evidence that astrocytes exhibit molecular and cellular heterogeneity; however, whether distinct subpopulations perform these diverse roles remains poorly defined. Here we show that the Lunatic Fringe-GFP (Lfng-GFP) bacteria artificial chromosome mouse line from both sexes specifically labels astrocyte populations within lamina III and IV of the dorsal spinal cord. Transcriptional profiling of Lfng-GFP astrocytes revealed unique molecular profiles, featuring an enriched expression of Notch- and Wnt- pathway components. Leveraging CRE-DOG viral tools, we ablated Lfng-GFP astrocytes, which decreased neuronal activity in lamina III and IV and impaired mechanosensation associated with light touch. Together, our findings identify Lfng-GFP astrocytes as a unique subpopulation that occupies a distinct anatomic location in the spinal cord and directly contributes to neuronal function and sensory responses. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the CNS, and their interactions with neurons are essential for brain function. However, understanding the functional diversity of astrocytes has been hindered because of the lack of reporters that mark subpopulations and genetic tools for accessing them. We discovered that the Lfng-GFP reporter mouse labels a laminae-specific subpopulation of astrocytes in the dorsal spinal cord and that ablation of these astrocytes reduces glutamatergic synapses. Further analysis revealed that these astrocytes have a role in maintaining sensory-processing circuity related to light touch.',\n",

Using established circuit models for NW-neuron interfaces, we discuss the impact of having multiple NWs interfacing with a single neuron on the amplitude and temporal characteristics of the recorded potentials. We review state of the art advances in nanoelectrode-neuron interfaces, the standard control experiments to investigate their electrophysiological behavior, and present recent high fidelity recordings of intracellular potentials obtained with ultrasharp NWs developed in our laboratory that naturally permeate neuronal cell bodies. Recordings from arrays and individually addressable electrically shorted NWs are presented, and the long-term stability of intracellular recording is discussed and put in the context of established techniques.

       "  'abstract': 'Opioids are widely used for pain relief; however, chronic opioid use causes a paradoxical state of enhanced pain sensitivity, termed \"Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH).\" Despite the clinical importance of OIH, the detailed mechanism by which it enhances pain sensitivity remains unclear. In this study, we tested whether repeated morphine induces a neuronal circuit polarization in the mouse spinal dorsal horn (SDH). Transgenic mice expressing GFP to neurokinin 1 receptor-expressing neurons (sNK1Rn) and GABAergic interneurons (sGABAn) that received morphine [20 mg/kg, once daily for four consecutive days (i.p.)] developed mechanical hypersensitivity. Repeated morphine altered synaptic strengths in the SDH as a specific cell-type but not in a gender-dependent manner. In sNK1Rn and non-tonic firing neurons, repeated morphine treatment significantly increased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) and evoked EPSC (eEPSC). In addition, repeated morphine treatment significantly decreased evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current (eIPSC) in sNK1Rn. Conversely, in sGABAn and tonic firing neurons, repeated morphine treatment significantly decreased sEPSC frequency and eEPSC, but had no change of eIPSC in sGABAn. Interestingly, repeated morphine treatment significantly decreased neuronal rheobase of sNK1Rn but had no effect on sGABAn. These findings suggest that spinal neuronal circuit polarization maybe the mechanism of OIH and identify a potential therapeutic mechanism to prevent or treat opioid-induced pain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by progressive neurodegeneration and characterised by motor dysfunction. Neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons also causes aberrations within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which has been hypothesised to lead to non-motor symptoms such as depression. Individuals with PD have both lower synaptic density and changes in neuronal metabolic function in the basal ganglia, as measured using [C]UCB-J and [F]FDG positron emission tomography (PET), respectively. However, the two radioligands have not been directly compared in the same PD subject or in neurodegeneration animal models. Here, we investigate [C]UCB-J binding and [F]FDG uptake in the CSTC circuit following a unilateral dopaminergic lesion in rats and compare it to sham lesioned rats. Rats received either a unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or saline in the medial forebrain bundle and rostral substantia nigra ( = 4/group). After 3 weeks, all rats underwent two PET scans using [F]FDG, followed by [C]UCB-J on a separate day. [F]FDG uptake and [C]UCB-J binding were both lower in the ipsilateral striatal regions compared to the contralateral regions. Using [C]UCB-J, we could detect an 8.7% decrease in the ipsilateral ventral midbrain, compared to a 2.9% decrease in ventral midbrain using [F]FDG. Differential changes between hemispheres for [C]UCB-J and [F]FDG outcomes were also evident in the CSTC circuit's cortical regions, especially in the orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex where higher synaptic density yet lower neuronal metabolic function was observed, following lesioning. In conclusion, [C]UCB-J and [F]FDG PET can detect divergent changes following a dopaminergic lesion in rats, especially in cortical regions that are not directly affected by the neurotoxin. These results suggest that combined [C]UCB-J and [F]FDG scans could yield a better picture of the heterogeneous cerebral changes in neurodegenerative disorders.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The experience of eating is inherently multimodal, combining intraoral gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory signals into a single percept called flavor. As foods and beverages enter the mouth, movements associated with chewing and swallowing activate somatosensory receptors in the oral cavity, dissolve tastants in the saliva to activate taste receptors, and release volatile odorant molecules to retronasally activate olfactory receptors in the nasal epithelium. Human studies indicate that sensory cortical areas are important for intraoral multimodal processing, yet their circuit-level mechanisms remain unclear. Animal models allow for detailed analyses of neural circuits due to the large number of molecular tools available for tracing and neuronal manipulations. In this review, we concentrate on the anatomical and neurophysiological evidence from rodent models toward a better understanding of the circuit-level mechanisms underlying the cortical processing of flavor. While more work is needed, the emerging view pertaining to the multimodal processing of food and beverages is that the piriform, gustatory, and somatosensory cortical regions do not function solely as independent areas. Rather they act as an intraoral cortical hub, simultaneously receiving and processing multimodal sensory information from the mouth to produce the rich and complex flavor experience that guides consummatory behavior.',\n",

However, the effects of immune system on neuronal function remain unknown. Herein, based on c-Fos protein expression, we characterized the brain areas that are activated after contextual fear conditioning (CFC) training or retrieval in severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) and wild-type mice. Further, we analyzed the interregional correlations of c-Fos activity that are affected by deficiency in adaptive immunity. Results showed significantly lower c-Fos density in learning and memory-associated brain regions of SCID mice after memory retrieval, but not during the CFC training. Moreover, SCID mice exhibited remarkably discordant interregional neuronal activities of learning neuron circuits after CFC training, which could be the cause of inefficient activation of the memory circuit after retrieval. These results provide a new perspective on how adaptive immunity affects neuronal function. Adaptive immune deficiency impairs the coordination of neural activity after training and retrieval, which might be a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The ability to form, retrieve and update autobiographical memories is one of the most fascinating features of human behavior. Spatial memory, the ability to remember the layout of the external environment and to navigate within its boundaries, is closely related to the autobiographical memory domain. It is served by an overlapping brain circuit, centered around the hippocampus (HPC) where the cognitive map index is stored. Apart from the hippocampus, several cortical structures participate in this process. Their relative contribution is a subject of intense research in both humans and animal models. One of the most widely studied regions is the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), an area in the parietal lobe densely interconnected with the hippocampal formation. Several methodological approaches have been established over decades in order to investigate the cortical aspects of memory. One of the most successful techniques is based on the analysis of brain expression patterns of the immediate early genes (IEGs). The common feature of this diverse group of genes is fast upregulation of their mRNA translation upon physiologically relevant stimulus. In the central nervous system they are rapidly triggered by neuronal activity and plasticity during learning. There is a widely accepted consensus that their expression level corresponds to the engagement of individual neurons in the formation of memory trace. Imaging of the IEGs might therefore provide a picture of an emerging memory engram. In this review we present the overview of IEG mapping studies of retrosplenial cortex in rodent models. We begin with classical techniques, immunohistochemical detection of protein and fluorescent in situ hybridization of mRNA. We then proceed to advanced methods where fluorescent genetically encoded IEG reporters are chronically followed in vivo during memory formation. We end with a combination of genetic IEG labelling and optogenetic approach, where the activity of the entire engram is manipulated. We finally present a hypothesis that attempts to unify our current state of knowledge about the function of RSC.',\n",

In this study, we used the spared nerve injury (SNI) model to characterize the development of sensory and aversive components of neuropathic pain and to determine their electrophysiological impact across prefrontal cortex and limbic regions. Moreover, we evaluated the regulation of several genes involved in immune response and inflammation triggered by SNI. We showed that SNI led to sensorial hypersensitivity (cold and mechanical stimuli) and depressive-like behavior lasting 12 months after nerve injury. Of interest, changes in nonemotional cognitive tasks (novel object recognition and Y maze) showed in 1-month SNI mice were not evident normal in the 12-month SNI animals. In vivo electrophysiology revealed an impaired long-term potentiation at prefrontal cortex-nucleus accumbens core pathway in both the 1-month and 12-month SNI mice. On the other hand, a reduced neural activity was recorded in the lateral entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus pathway in the 1-month SNI mice, but not in the 12-month SNI mice. Finally, we observed the upregulation of specific genes involved in immune response in the hippocampus of 1-month SNI mice, but not in the 12-month SNI mice, suggesting a neuroinflammatory response that may contribute to the SNI phenotype. These data suggest that distinct brain circuits may drive the psychiatric components of neuropathic pain and pave the way for better investigation of the long-term consequences of peripheral nerve injury for which most of the available drugs are to date unsatisfactory.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Memory consolidation is a time-dependent process through which an unstable learned experience is transformed into a stable long-term memory; however, the circuit and molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. The  mushroom body (MB) is a huge brain neuropil that plays a crucial role in olfactory memory. The MB neurons can be generally classified into three subsets: γ, αβ, and α'β'. Here, we report that water-reward long-term memory (wLTM) consolidation requires activity from α'β'-related mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) in a specific time window. wLTM consolidation requires neurotransmission in MBON-γ3β'1 during the 0-2\\xa0h period after training, and neurotransmission in MBON-α'2 is required during the 2-4\\xa0h period after training. Moreover, neurotransmission in MBON-α'1α'3 is required during the 0-4\\xa0h period after training. Intriguingly, blocking neurotransmission during consolidation or inhibiting serotonin biosynthesis in serotoninergic dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons also disrupted the wLTM, suggesting that wLTM consolidation requires serotonin signals from DPM neurons. The GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) data showed the connectivity between DPM neurons and MBON-γ3β'1, MBON-α'2, and MBON-α'1α'3, and RNAi-mediated silencing of serotonin receptors in MBON-γ3β'1, MBON-α'2, or MBON-α'1α'3 disrupted wLTM. Taken together, our results suggest that serotonin released from DPM neurons modulates neuronal activity in MBON-γ3β'1, MBON-α'2, and MBON-α'1α'3\\xa0at specific time windows, which is critical for the consolidation of wLTM in .\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Brain-wide neural circuits enable bi- and quadrupeds to express adaptive locomotor behaviors in a context- and state-dependent manner, e.g., in response to threats or rewards. These behaviors include dynamic transitions between initiation, maintenance and termination of locomotion. Advances within the last decade have revealed an intricate coordination of these individual locomotion phases by complex interaction of multiple brain circuits. This review provides an overview of the neural basis of state-dependent modulation of locomotion initiation, maintenance and termination, with a focus on insights from circuit-centered studies in rodents. The reviewed evidence indicates that a brain-wide network involving excitatory circuit elements connecting cortex, midbrain and medullary areas appears to be the common substrate for the initiation of locomotion across different higher-order states. Specific network elements within motor cortex and the mesencephalic locomotor region drive the initial postural adjustment and the initiation of locomotion. Microcircuits of the basal ganglia, by implementing action-selection computations, trigger goal-directed locomotion. The initiation of locomotion is regulated by neuromodulatory circuits residing in the basal forebrain, the hypothalamus, and medullary regions such as locus coeruleus. The maintenance of locomotion requires the interaction of an even larger neuronal network involving motor, sensory and associative cortical elements, as well as defined circuits within the superior colliculus, the cerebellum, the periaqueductal gray, the mesencephalic locomotor region and the medullary reticular formation. Finally, locomotor arrest as an important component of defensive emotional states, such as acute anxiety, is mediated via a network of survival circuits involving hypothalamus, amygdala, periaqueductal gray and medullary premotor centers. By moving beyond the organizational principle of functional brain regions, this review promotes a circuit-centered perspective of locomotor regulation by higher-order states, and emphasizes the importance of individual network elements such as cell types and projection pathways. The realization that dysfunction within smaller, identifiable circuit elements can affect the larger network function supports more mechanistic and targeted therapeutic intervention in the treatment of motor network disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the increasing popularity of calcium imaging in neuroscience research, choosing the right methods to analyze calcium imaging data is critical to address various scientific questions. Unlike spike trains measured using electrodes, fluorescence intensity traces provide an indirect and noisy measurement of the underlying neuronal activities. The observed calcium traces are either analyzed directly or deconvolved to spike trains to infer neuronal activities. When both approaches are applicable, it is unclear whether deconvolving calcium traces is a necessary step. In this article, we compare the performance of using calcium traces or their deconvolved spike trains for three common analyses: clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and population decoding. We found that (1) the two approaches lead to diverging results; (2) estimated spike trains, when smoothed or binned appropriately, usually lead to satisfactory performances, such as more accurate estimation of cluster membership; (3) although estimate spike train produce results more similar to true spike data than trace data, we found that the PCA results from trace data might better reflect the underlying neuronal ensembles (clusters); and (4) for both approaches, decobability can be improved by using denoising or smoothing methods. Our simulations and applications to real data suggest that estimated spike data outperform trace data in cluster analysis and give comparable results for population decoding. In addition, the decobability of estimated spike data can be slightly better than that of calcium trace data with appropriate filtering / smoothing methods. We conclude that spike detection might be a useful pre-processing step for certain problems such as clustering; however, the continuous nature of calcium imaging data provides a natural smoothness that might be helpful for problems such as dimensional reduction.

In the hippocampus, it remains unknown whether local computations supported by specific connectivity motifs regulate the spatial receptive fields of pyramidal cells. Here we developed an in vivo electroporation method for monosynaptic retrograde tracing and optogenetics manipulation at single-cell resolution to interrogate the dynamic interaction of place cells with their microcircuitry during navigation. We found a local circuit mechanism in CA1 whereby the spatial tuning of an individual place cell can propagate to a functionally recurrent subnetwork to which it belongs. The emergence of place fields in individual neurons led to the development of inverse selectivity in a subset of their presynaptic interneurons, and recruited functionally coupled place cells at that location. Thus, the spatial selectivity of single CA1 neurons is amplified through local circuit plasticity to enable effective multi-neuronal representations that can flexibly scale environmental features locally without degrading the feedforward input structure.',\n",

Current ex-vivo biosensing techniques are limited to recording a small set of neurons and cannot provide an adequate resolution, which hinders revealing the fast dynamic underlying the information coding mechanisms in the OB circuit. Here, we demonstrate a novel biohybrid OB-CMOS biosensing platform to decipher the cross-scale dynamics of the OB electrogenesis and quantify the distinct neuronal coding properties. The approach with 4096-microelectrodes offers a non-invasive, label-free, bioelectrical imaging to decode simultaneous firing patterns from thousands of connected neuronal ensembles in acute OB slices. The platform can measure spontaneous and drug-induced extracellular field potential activity with substantially improved spatiotemporal resolution over conventional OB-based biosensors. Also, we employ our OB-CMOS recordings to perform multidimensional analysis to instantiate specific neurophysiological metrics underlying the olfactory spatiotemporal coding that emerged from the OB interconnected layers. Our results delineate the computational implications of large-scale activity patterns in functional olfactory processing. The systematic interplay of the experimental CMOS-base platform architecture and the high-content characterization of the olfactory circuit with various computational analyses endow significant functional interrogations of the OB information processing, high-spatiotemporal connectivity mapping, and global circuit dynamics. Thus, our study can inspire the design of advanced biomimetic olfactory-based biosensors and neuromorphic approaches for diagnostic biomarkers and drug discovery applications.',\n",

The dentate nuclei of the cerebellum receive excitatory input from different brain regions. Purkinje cell loss due to chronic seizures could lead to decreased inhibition of these excitatory neurons, resulting in the activation of apoptotic cascades in the dentate nucleus. The present study was designed to determine whether there is a presence of apoptosis (either intrinsic or extrinsic) in the dentate nucleus, the final relay of the cerebellar circuit, following kindling-induced seizures. In order to determine this, seizures were triggered via the amygdaloid kindling model. Following 0, 15, or 45 stimuli, rats were sacrificed, and the cerebellum was extracted. It was posteriorly prepared for the immunohistochemical analysis with cell death biomarkers: TUNEL, Bcl-2, truncated Bid (tBid), Bax, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase 3 (active form). Our findings reproduce results obtained in other parts of the cerebellum. We found a decrease of Bcl-2 expression, an anti-apoptotic protein, in the dentate nucleus of kindled rats. We also determined the presence of TUNEL-positive neurons, which confirms the presence of apoptosis in the dentate nucleus. We observed the expression of tBid, Bax, as well as cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3, the main executor caspase of apoptosis.

Here, we describe a three-part neural circuit that imparts satiety-dependent modulation of fructose sensing. We show that dorsal fan-shaped body neurons display oscillatory calcium activity when hemolymph glucose is high and that these oscillations require glutamatergic input from SLP-AB or “Janus” neurons projecting from the protocerebrum to the asymmetric body. Suppression of activity in this circuit, either by starvation or by genetic silencing, promotes specific drive for fructose ingestion. This is achieved through neuropeptidergic signaling by tachykinin, which is released from the fan-shaped body when glycemia is high. Tachykinin, in turn, signals to Gr43a-positive fructose sensors to modulate their response to fructose. Together, our results demonstrate how a three-layer neural circuit links the detection of two sugars to produce precise satiety-dependent control of feeding behavior.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The lower urinary tract is believed to be centrally regulated with the involvement of a range of neurotransmitters. The parasympathetic excitatory input to the urinary bladder is suppressed when the serotonergic system is activated, and thereby voiding is blocked. In healthy people, continence is usually underpinned by hippocampal formation (circuit 3). In order to advance knowledge of how serotoninergic neurons and additional nerve fibers were correlated, the purpose of the present work was to research how the discharge of serotonin from hippocampal slices was affected by different neurotransmitters in rat models. The adopted procedure involved administration of the central neurotransmitters acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and neuropeptide Y as well as monitoring of the alterations in the discharge of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Furthermore, to determine whether the effect of the neurotransmitters was influenced by interneuron, tetrodotoxin was also employed. Acetylcholine (10-5M) did not alter [3H]5-HT discharge, whereas more 5-HT was discharged from the hippocampal slices of rats under stimulation by norepinephrine (10-5M) as well as dopamine (10-5M) and tetrodotoxin (10-6M) did not inhibit the discharge. By contrast, tetrodotoxin inhibited the discharge of [3H]5-HT that was exacerbated by NMDA (10-4M). Meanwhile, compared to control, GABA (10-5M), glycine (10-5M), or neuropeptide Y (10-6M) did not alter the [3H]5-HT discharge. From the research findings, it can be concluded that 5-HT discharge from rat hippocampus is enhanced by norepinephrine and dopamine through direct effect on the 5-HT neuronal terminal. By contrast, 5-HT discharge is intensified by NMDA by activating interneurons. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Finding out the physical structure of neuronal circuits that governs neuronal responses is an important goal for brain research. With fast advances for large-scale recording techniques, identification of a neuronal circuit with multiple neurons and stages or layers becomes possible and highly demanding. Although methods for mapping the connection structure of circuits have been greatly developed in recent years, they are mostly limited to simple scenarios of a few neurons in a pairwise fashion; and dissecting dynamical circuits, particularly mapping out a complete functional circuit that converges to a single neuron, is still a challenging question. Here, we show that a recent method, termed spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization (STNMF), can address these issues. By simulating different scenarios of spiking neural networks with various connections between neurons and stages, we demonstrate that STNMF is a persuasive method to dissect functional connections within a circuit. Using spiking activities recorded at neurons of the output layer, STNMF can obtain a complete circuit consisting of all cascade computational components of presynaptic neurons, as well as their spiking activities. For simulated simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex, STNMF allows us to dissect the pathway of visual computation. Taken together, these results suggest that STNMF could provide a useful approach for investigating neuronal systems leveraging recorded functional neuronal activity.',\n",

To develop effective therapeutic treatments for AD, we need to better understand the neural mechanisms by which AD causes memory loss and cognitive deficits. Here we examine large-scale hippocampal neural population calcium activities imaged at single cell resolution in a triple-transgenic Alzheimer\\'s disease mouse model (3xTg-AD) that presents both amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary pathological features along with age-related behavioral defects. To measure encoding of environmental location in hippocampal neural ensembles in the 3xTg-AD mice in vivo, we performed GCaMP6-based calcium imaging using head-mounted, miniature fluorescent microscopes (\"miniscopes\") on freely moving animals. We compared hippocampal CA1 excitatory neural ensemble activities during open-field exploration and track-based route-running behaviors in age-matched AD and control mice at young (3-6.5\\xa0months old) and old (18-21\\xa0months old) ages. During open-field exploration, 3xTg-AD CA1 excitatory cells display significantly higher calcium activity rates compared with Non-Tg controls for both the young and old age groups, suggesting that in vivo enhanced neuronal calcium ensemble activity is a disease feature. CA1 neuronal populations of 3xTg-AD mice show lower spatial information scores compared with control mice. The spatial firing of CA1 neurons of old 3xTg-AD mice also displays higher sparsity and spatial coherence, indicating less place specificity for spatial representation. We find locomotor speed significantly modulates the amplitude of hippocampal neural calcium ensemble activities to a greater extent in 3xTg-AD mice during open field exploration. Our data offer new and comprehensive information about age-dependent neural circuit activity changes in this important AD mouse model and provide strong evidence that spatial coding defects in the neuronal population activities are associated with AD pathology and AD-related memory behavioral deficits.',\n",

However, the causal role of dopamine in aggression and its target circuit mechanisms are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the modulatory role of the population- and projection-specific dopamine function in a murine model of aggressive behavior. We find that terminal activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons selectively projecting to the lateral septum (LS) is sufficient for promoting aggression and necessary for establishing baseline aggression. Within the LS, dopamine acts on D2-receptors to inhibit GABAergic neurons, and septal D2-signaling is necessary for VTA dopaminergic activity to promote aggression. Collectively, our data reveal a powerful modulatory influence of dopaminergic synaptic input on LS function and aggression, effectively linking the clinically pertinent hyper-dopaminergic model of aggression with the classic septal-hypothalamic aggression axis.',\n",

Here, we review the methods of dynamic morphometrics sampling and analyses, focusing on their applications to studies of activity-driven dendritogenesis in vertebrate systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The neural network in the brain can be viewed as an integrated system assembled from a large number of local neural circuits specialized for particular brain functions. Activities of neurons in local neural circuits are thought to be organized both spatially and temporally under the rules optimized for their roles in information processing. It is well perceived that different areas of the mammalian neocortex have specific cognitive functions and distinct computational properties. However, the organizational principles of the local neural circuits in different cortical regions have not yet been clarified. Therefore, new research principles and related neuro-technologies that enable efficient and precise recording of large-scale neuronal activities and synaptic connections are necessary. Innovative technologies for structural analysis, including tissue clearing and expansion microscopy, have enabled super resolution imaging of the neural circuits containing thousands of neurons at a single synapse resolution. The imaging resolution and volume achieved by new technologies are beyond the limits of conventional light or electron microscopic methods. Progress in genome editing and related technologies has made it possible to label and manipulate specific cell types and discriminate activities of multiple cell types. These technologies will provide a breakthrough for multiscale analysis of the structure and function of local neural circuits. This review summarizes the basic concepts and practical applications of the emerging technologies and new insight into local neural circuits obtained by these technologies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a hemodynamic-based functional neuroimaging technique, primarily used in animal models, that combines a high spatiotemporal resolution, a large field of view, and compatibility with behavior. These assets make fUS especially suited to interrogating brain activity at the systems level. In this review, we describe the technical capabilities offered by fUS and discuss how this technique can contribute to the field of functional connectomics. First, fUS can be used to study intrinsic functional connectivity, namely patterns of correlated activity between brain regions. In this area, fUS has made the most impact by following connectivity changes in disease models, across behavioral states, or dynamically. Second, fUS can also be used to map brain-wide pathways associated with an external event. For example, fUS has helped obtain finer descriptions of several sensory systems, and uncover new pathways implicated in specific behaviors. Additionally, combining fUS with direct circuit manipulations such as optogenetics is an attractive way to map the brain-wide connections of defined neuronal populations. Finally, technological improvements and the application of new analytical tools promise to boost fUS capabilities. As brain coverage and the range of behavioral contexts that can be addressed with fUS keep on increasing, we believe that fUS-guided connectomics will only expand in the future. In this regard, we consider the incorporation of fUS into multimodal studies combining diverse techniques and behavioral tasks to be the most promising research avenue.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Homeostatic plasticity of intrinsic excitability goes hand in hand with homeostatic plasticity of synaptic transmission. However, the mechanisms linking the two forms of homeostatic regulation have not been identified so far. Using electrophysiological, imaging, and immunohistochemical techniques, we show here that blockade of excitatory synaptic receptors for 2 to 3 d induces an up-regulation of both synaptic transmission at CA3-CA3 connections and intrinsic excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Intrinsic plasticity was found to be mediated by a reduction of Kv1.1 channel density at the axon initial segment. In activity-deprived circuits, CA3-CA3 synapses were found to express a high release probability, an insensitivity to dendrotoxin, and a lack of depolarization-induced presynaptic facilitation, indicating a reduction in presynaptic Kv1.1 function. Further support for the down-regulation of axonal Kv1.1 channels in activity-deprived neurons was the broadening of action potentials measured in the axon. We conclude that regulation of the axonal Kv1.1 channel constitutes a major mechanism linking intrinsic excitability and synaptic strength that accounts for the functional synergy existing between homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Animals display selective escape behaviors when faced with environmental threats. Selection of the appropriate response by the underlying neuronal network is key to maximizing chances of survival, yet the underlying network mechanisms are so far not fully understood. Using synapse-level reconstruction of the Drosophila larval network paired with physiological and behavioral readouts, we uncovered a circuit that gates selective escape behavior for noxious light through acute and input-specific neuropeptide action. Sensory neurons required for avoidance of noxious light and escape in response to harsh touch, each converge on discrete domains of neuromodulatory hub neurons. We show that acute release of hub neuron-derived insulin-like peptide 7 (Ilp7) and cognate relaxin family receptor (Lgr4) signaling in downstream neurons are required for noxious light avoidance, but not harsh touch responses. Our work highlights a role for compartmentalized circuit organization and neuropeptide release from regulatory hubs, acting as central circuit elements gating escape responses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy and autism have been linked to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition (E/I) in the central nervous system. The simplicity and tractability of C. elegans allows our electroconvulsive seizure (ES) assay to be used as a behavioral readout of the locomotor circuit and neuronal function. C. elegans possess conserved nervous system features such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA receptors in inhibitory neurotransmission, and acetylcholine (Ach) and acetylcholine receptors in excitatory neurotransmission. Our previously published data has shown that decreasing inhibition in the motor circuit, via GABAergic manipulation, will extend the time of locomotor recovery following electroshock. Similarly, mutations in a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase called EEL-1 leads to impaired GABAergic transmission, E/I imbalance and altered sensitivity to electroshock. Mutations in the human ortholog of EEL-1, called HUWE1, are associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability. Both EEL-1 and its previously established binding protein, OGT-1, are expressed in GABAergic motor neurons, localize to GABAergic presynaptic terminals, and function in parallel to regulate GABA neuron function. In this study, we tested behavioral responses to electroshock in wildtype, ogt-1, eel-1 and ogt-1; eel-1 double mutants. Both ogt-1 and eel-1 null mutants have decreased inhibitory GABAergic neuron function and increased electroshock sensitivity. Consistent with EEL-1 and OGT-1 functioning in parallel pathways, ogt-1; eel-1 double mutants showed enhanced electroshock susceptibility. Expression of OGT-1 in the C. elegans nervous system rescued enhanced electroshock defects in ogt-1; eel-1 double mutants. Application of a GABA agonist, Baclofen, decreased electroshock susceptibility in all animals. Our C. elegans electroconvulsive seizure assay was the first to model a human X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) associated with epilepsy and suggests a potential novel role for the OGT-1/EEL-1 complex in seizure susceptibility.',\n",

Although the dopamine reward system has been implicated in SB, it is not clear which neuronal populations are relevant and how they contribute. Here, we adopted a learned helplessness (LH) animal model of depression and found that LH subjects housed with a conspecific partner show better performance in the shuttle box test, showing that SB improves the stress-coping abilities to deal with stress. Bidirectional manipulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons by chemogenetic tools can mimic or block the SB effect in LH mice. To screen for SB-induced structure plasticity of VTA dopamine neurons, we employed viral genetic tools for mapping input and output architecture and found LH- and SB-triggered circuit-level changes in neuronal ensembles. Zona incerta (ZI), an overlapping brain region, was significantly changed in both anterograde and retrograde tracing during LH and SB. These results reveal a neural loop with structural plasticity between VTA dopamine neurons and ZI underlies the SB effects in LH and lays a foundation for studying how VTA dopamine neurons regulate SB-related neural circuits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Understanding how neurons of the striatum are formed and integrate into complex synaptic circuits is essential to provide insight into striatal function in health and disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the development of striatal neurons and associated circuits with a focus on their embryonic origin. Specifically, we address the role of distinct types of embryonic progenitors, found in the proliferative zones of the ganglionic eminences in the ventral telencephalon, in the generation of diverse striatal interneurons and projection neurons. Indeed, recent evidence would suggest that embryonic progenitor origin dictates key characteristics of postnatal cells, including their neurochemical content, their location within striatum, and their long-range synaptic inputs. We also integrate recent observations regarding embryonic progenitors in cortical and other regions and discuss how this might inform future research on the ganglionic eminences. Last, we examine how embryonic progenitor dysfunction can alter striatal formation, as exemplified in Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder, and how increased understanding of embryonic progenitors can have significant implications for future research directions and the development of improved therapeutic options. This review highlights recently defined novel roles for embryonic progenitor cells in shaping the functional properties of both projection neurons and interneurons of the striatum. It outlines the developmental mechanisms that guide neuronal development from progenitors in the embryonic ganglionic eminences to progeny in the striatum. Where questions remain open, we integrate observations from cortex and other regions to present possible avenues for future research. Last, we provide a progenitor-centric perspective onto both Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder. We suggest that future investigations and manipulations of embryonic progenitor cells in both research and clinical settings will likely require careful consideration of their great intrinsic diversity and neurogenic potential.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'α2δ proteins (CACNA2D1-4) are required for normal neurological function and contribute to membrane trafficking of voltage-gated calcium channels, through which calcium entry initiates numerous physiological processes. However, it remains unclear how α2δ proteins influence calcium-mediated signalling to control neuronal output. Using whole-cell recordings of mouse Purkinje cells, we show that α2δ-2 is required for functional coupling of postsynaptic voltage-dependent calcium entry with calcium-dependent effector mechanisms controlling two different outputs, depolarization-induced suppression of excitation and spike afterhyperpolarization. Our findings indicate an important role for α2δ-2 proteins in regulating functional postsynaptic calcium channel coupling in neurons, providing new context for understanding the effects of α2δ mutations on neuronal circuit function and presenting additional potential avenues to manipulate α2δ-mediated signalling for therapeutic gain. KEY POINTS: Calcium influx, via voltage-dependent calcium channels, drives numerous neuronal signalling processes with precision achieved in part by tight coupling between calcium entry and calcium-dependent effectors. α2δ proteins are important for neurological function and contribute to calcium channel membrane trafficking, although how α2δ proteins influence postsynaptic calcium-dependent signalling is largely unexplored. Here it is shown that loss of α2δ-2 proteins disrupts functional calcium coupling to two different postsynaptic calcium-dependent signals in mouse Purkinje cell neurons, retrograde endocannabinoid signalling and the action potential afterhyperpolarization. The findings provide new insights into the control of calcium coupling as well as new roles for\\xa0α2δ-2 proteins in neurons.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Acupuncture at acupoints Baihui (GV20) and Dazhui (GV14) has been shown to promote functional recovery after stroke. However, the contribution of the contralateral primary sensory cortex (S1) to recovery remains unclear. In this study, unilateral local ischemic infarction of the primary motor cortex (M1) was induced by photothrombosis in a mouse model. Electroacupuncture (EA) was subsequently performed at acupoints GV20 and GV14 and neuronal activity and functional connectivity of contralateral S1 and M1 were detected using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recording techniques. Our results showed that blood perfusion and neuronal interaction between contralateral M1 and S1 is impaired after unilateral M1 infarction. Intrinsic neuronal excitability and activity were also disturbed, which was rescued by EA. Furthermore, the effectiveness of EA treatment was inhibited after virus-mediated neuronal ablation of the contralateral S1. We conclude that neuronal activity of the contralateral S1 is important for EA-mediated recovery after focal M1 infarction. Our study provides insight into how the S1-M1 circuit might be involved in the mechanism of EA treatment of unilateral cerebral infarction.

       "  'abstract': 'The human brain contains an estimated 100 billion neurons that must be systematically organized into functional neural circuits for it to function properly. These circuits range from short-range local signaling networks between neighboring neurons to long-range networks formed between various brain regions. Compelling converging evidence indicates that alterations in neural circuits arising from abnormalities during early neuronal development or neurodegeneration contribute significantly to the etiology of neurological disorders. Supporting this notion, efforts to identify genetic causes of these disorders have uncovered an over-representation of genes encoding proteins involved in the processes of neuronal differentiation, maturation, synaptogenesis and synaptic function. Fasciculation and elongation protein zeta-1, a Kinesin-1 adapter, has emerged as a key central player involved in many of these processes. Fasciculation and elongation protein zeta-1-dependent transport of synaptic cargoes and mitochondria is essential for neuronal development and synapse establishment. Furthermore, it acts downstream of guidance cue pathways to regulate axo-dendritic development. Significantly, perturbing its function causes abnormalities in neuronal development and synapse formation both in the brain as well as the peripheral nervous system. Mutations and deletions of the fasciculation and elongation protein zeta-1 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, altered phosphorylation of the protein contributes to neurodegenerative disorders. Together, these findings strongly implicate the importance of fasciculation and elongation protein zeta-1 in the establishment of neuronal circuits and its maintenance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A series of studies in which monkeys chose between two juices offered in variable amounts identified in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) different groups of neurons encoding the value of individual options (offer value), the binary choice outcome (chosen juice), and the chosen value. These variables capture both the input and the output of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. However, in previous experiments offers were presented simultaneously, raising the question of whether current notions generalize to when goods are presented or are examined in sequence. Recently, Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa (2019) examined OFC activity under sequential offers. An analysis of neuronal responses across time windows revealed that a small number of cell groups encoded specific sequences of variables. These sequences appeared analogous to the variables identified under simultaneous offers, but the correspondence remained tentative. Thus, in the present study, we examined the relation between cell groups found under sequential versus simultaneous offers. We recorded from the OFC while monkeys chose between different juices. Trials with simultaneous and sequential offers were randomly interleaved in each session. We classified cells in each choice modality, and we examined the relation between the two classifications. We found a strong correspondence; in other words, the cell groups measured under simultaneous offers and under sequential offers were one and the same. This result indicates that economic choices under simultaneous or sequential offers rely on the same neural circuit. Research in the past 20 years has shed light on the neuronal underpinnings of economic choices. A large number of results indicates that decisions between goods are formed in a neural circuit within the orbitofrontal cortex. In most previous studies, subjects chose between two goods offered simultaneously. Yet, in daily situations, goods available for choice are often presented or examined in sequence. Here we recorded neuronal activity in the primate orbitofrontal cortex alternating trials under simultaneous and under sequential offers. Our analyses demonstrate that the same neural circuit supports choices in the two modalities. Hence, current notions on the neuronal mechanisms underlying economic decisions generalize to choices under sequential offers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modulation of neuronal circuit activity is key to information processing in the brain. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the targets of most neuromodulatory ligands, show extremely diverse expression patterns in neurons and receptors can be localized in various sub-neuronal membrane compartments. Upon activation, GPCRs promote signaling cascades that alter the level of second messengers, drive phosphorylation changes, modulate ion channel function, and influence gene expression, all of which critically impact neuron physiology. Because of its high degree of complexity, this form of interneuronal communication has remained challenging to integrate into our conceptual understanding of brain function. Recent technological advances in fluorescence microscopy and the development of optical biosensors now allow investigating neuromodulation with unprecedented resolution on the level of individual cells. In this review, we will highlight recent imaging techniques that enable determining the precise localization of GPCRs in neurons, with specific focus on the subcellular and nanoscale level. Downstream of receptors, we describe novel conformation-specific biosensors that allow for real-time monitoring of GPCR activation and of distinct signal transduction events in neurons. Applying these new tools has the potential to provide critical insights into the function and organization of GPCRs in neuronal cells and may help decipher the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie neuromodulation.',\n",

According to a neuroplasticity hypothesis for how some cognitive behavioural therapies are effective, cognitive control training (CCT) changes neural circuit information processing. Here we investigated whether CCT persistently alters hippocampal neural circuit function. We show that mice learned and remembered a conditioned place avoidance during CCT that required ignoring irrelevant locations of shock. CCT facilitated learning new tasks in novel environments for several weeks, relative to unconditioned controls and control mice that avoided the same place during reduced distraction. CCT rapidly changes entorhinal cortex-to-dentate gyrus synaptic circuit function, resulting in an excitatory-inhibitory subcircuit change that persists for months. CCT increases inhibition that attenuates the dentate response to medial entorhinal cortical input, and through disinhibition, potentiates the response to strong inputs, pointing to overall signal-to-noise enhancement. These neurobiological findings support the neuroplasticity hypothesis that, as well as storing item-event associations, CCT persistently optimizes neural circuit information processing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Glutamatergic synapses are key cellular sites where cocaine experience creates memory traces that subsequently promote cocaine craving and seeking. In addition to making across-the-board synaptic adaptations, cocaine experience also generates a discrete population of new synapses that selectively encode cocaine memories. These new synapses are glutamatergic synapses that lack functionally stable AMPARs, often referred to as AMPAR-silent synapses or, simply, silent synapses. They are generated  in the NAc by cocaine experience. After drug withdrawal, some of these synapses mature by recruiting AMPARs, contributing to the consolidation of cocaine-associated memory. After cue-induced retrieval of cocaine memories, matured silent synapses alternate between two dynamic states (AMPAR-absent vs AMPAR-containing) that correspond with the behavioral manifestations of destabilization and reconsolidation of these memories. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying silent synapse dynamics during behavior, discuss their contributions to circuit remodeling, and analyze their role in cocaine-memory-driven behaviors. We also propose several mechanisms through which silent synapses can form neuronal ensembles as well as cross-region circuit engrams for cocaine-specific behaviors. These perspectives lead to our hypothesis that cocaine-generated silent synapses stand as a distinct set of synaptic substrates encoding key aspects of cocaine memory that drive cocaine relapse.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is important for the control of movement as it encodes sensory input from the body periphery and external environment during ongoing movement. Mouse S1 consists of several distinct sensorimotor subnetworks that receive topographically organized corticocortical inputs from distant sensorimotor areas, including the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and primary motor cortex (M1). The role of the vibrissal S1 area and associated cortical connections during active sensing is well documented, but whether (and if so, how) non-whisker S1 areas are involved in movement control remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that unilateral silencing of the non-whisker S1 area in both male and female mice disrupts hind paw movement during locomotion on a rotarod and a runway. S2 and M1 provide major long-range inputs to this S1 area. Silencing S2→non-whisker S1 projections alters the hind paw orientation during locomotion, whereas manipulation of the M1 projection has little effect. Using patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from male and female mice, we show that S2 projection preferentially innervates inhibitory interneuron subtypes. We conclude that interneuron-mediated S2-S1 corticocortical interactions are critical for efficient locomotion. Somatosensory cortex participates in controlling rhythmic movements, such as whisking and walking, but the neural circuitry underlying movement control by somatosensory cortex remains relatively unexplored. We uncover a corticocortical circuit in primary somatosensory cortex that regulates paw orientation during locomotion in mice. We identify neuronal elements that comprise these cortical pathways using pharmacology, behavioral assays, and circuit-mapping methods.',\n",

Here, we report distinct actions of GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on tonic inhibition in hippocampal neurons under basal and high activity conditions. Specifically, overexpression of GluN2B, but not GluN2A, reduces α5-GABAR surface expression and tonic currents. Additionally, knockout of GluN2A and GluN2B decreases and increases tonic currents, respectively. Mechanistically, GluN2A-NMDARs inhibit and GluN2B-NMDARs promote α5-GABAR internalization, resulting in increased and decreased surface α5-GABAR expression, respectively. Furthermore, GluN2A-NMDARs, but not GluN2B-NMDARs, are required for homeostatic potentiation of tonic inhibition induced by prolonged increase of neuronal activity. Last, tonic inhibition decreases during acute seizures, whereas it increases 24\\xa0h later, involving GluN2-NMDAR-dependent signaling. Collectively, these data reveal an NMDAR subunit-specific regulation of tonic inhibition in physiological and pathological conditions and provide mechanistic insight into activity-dependent modulation of tonic inhibition.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Motor control requires precise temporal and spatial encoding across distinct motor centers that is refined through the repetition of learning. The recruitment of motor regions requires modulatory input to shape circuit activity. Here, we identify a role for the baso-cortical cholinergic pathway in the acquisition of a coordinated motor skill in mice. Targeted depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons results in significant impairments in training on the rotarod task of coordinated movement. Cholinergic neuromodulation is required during training sessions as chemogenetic inactivation of cholinergic neurons also impairs task acquisition. Rotarod learning is known to drive refinement of corticostriatal neurons arising in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, and we have found that cholinergic input to both motor regions is required for task acquisition. Critically, the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation are restricted to the acquisition stage, as depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons after learning does not affect task execution. Our results indicate a critical role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning. Acetylcholine release from basal forebrain cholinergic neuron terminals rapidly modulates neuronal excitability, circuit dynamics, and cortical coding; all processes required for processing complex sensory information, cognition, and attention. We found that depletion or transient silencing of cholinergic inputs to anatomically isolated motor areas, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, selectively led to significant impairments on coordinated motor learning; disrupting this baso-cortical network after acquisition elicited no effect on task execution. Our results indicate a pivotal role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning. These findings support the concept that cognitive components (such as attention) are indispensable in the adjustment of motor output and training-induced improvements in motor performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Heavy alcohol consumption followed by periods of abstinence (i.e., binge drinking) during adolescence is a concern for both acute and chronic health issues. Persistent brain damage after adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure in rodents, a model of binge drinking, includes reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and a loss of neurons in the basal forebrain that express the cholinergic phenotype. The circuit formed between those regions, the septohippocampal pathway, is critical for learning and memory. Furthermore, this circuit is also altered during the aging process. Thus, we examined whether pathology in septohippocampal circuit and impairments in spatial behaviors are amplified during aging following adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure. Female and male rats were exposed to intermittent intragastric gavage of water (control) or 20% ethanol (dose of 5 g/kg) for a 2 days on/off cycle from postnatal days 25-55. Either 2 (young adult) or 12-14 (middle-age) months post exposure, rats were tested on two spatial tasks: spontaneous alternation and novel object in place. Acetylcholine efflux was assessed in the hippocampus during both tasks. There was no adolescent ethanol-induced deficit on spontaneous alternation, but middle-aged male rats displayed lower alternation rates. Male rats exposed to ethanol during adolescence had blunted behavioral evoked acetylcholine during spontaneous alternation testing. All ethanol-exposed rats displayed suppression of the cholinergic neuronal phenotype. On the novel object in place task, regardless of sex, ethanol-exposed rats performed significantly worse than control-treated rats, and middle aged-rats, regardless of sex or ethanol exposure, were significantly impaired relative to young adult rats. These results indicate that male rats display earlier age-related cognitive impairment on a working memory task. Furthermore, male rats exposed to ethanol during adolescence have blunted behavior-evoked hippocampal acetylcholine efflux. In addition, middle-aged and ethanol-exposed rats, regardless of sex, are impaired at determining discrete spatial relationship between objects. This type of pattern separation impairment was associated with a loss of neurogenesis. Thus, binge-type adolescent ethanol exposure does affect the septohippocampal circuit, and can accelerate age-related cognitive impairment on select spatial tasks.',\n",

However, prior research on correlations between these three factors revealed many limitations. In particular, profiling and modeling of the connectivity of complex neural circuits at the cellular level are highly challenging. To reduce the burden of the analysis, we suggest a new approach with simplification of the neural connection in an array of honeycomb patterns on 2D, using a microcontact printing technique. Through a series of guided neuronal growths in defined honeycomb patterns, a simplified neuronal circuit was achieved. Our approach allowed us to obtain the whole network connectivity at cellular resolution using a combination of stochastic multicolor labeling via viral transfection. Therefore, we were able to identify several types of hub neurons with distinct connectivity features. We also compared the structural differences between different circuits using three-node motif analysis.

For example, in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to the preferred orientation are modulated by the presence of superimposed orientations (\"plaids\"). The effects of this modulation are diverse; some neurons are suppressed, while others have larger responses to a plaid than its components. We investigated whether this diversity could be explained by a unified circuit mechanism. We report that this masking is maintained during suppression of cortical activity, arguing against cortical mechanisms. Instead, the heterogeneity of plaid responses is explained by an interaction between stimulus geometry and orientation tuning. Highly selective neurons are uniformly suppressed by plaids, whereas the effects in weakly selective neurons depend on the spatial configuration of the stimulus, transitioning systematically between suppression and facilitation. Thus, the diverse responses emerge as a consequence of the spatial structure of feedforward inputs, with no need to invoke cortical interactions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The brain generates internal representations that translate sensory stimuli into appropriate behavior. In the taste system, different tastes activate distinct populations of sensory neurons. We investigated the temporal properties of taste responses in Drosophila and discovered that different types of taste sensory neurons show striking differences in their response dynamics. Strong responses to stimulus onset (ON responses) and offset (OFF responses) were observed in bitter-sensing neurons in the labellum, whereas bitter neurons in the leg and other classes of labellar taste neurons showed only an ON response. Individual labellar bitter neurons generate both ON and OFF responses through a cell-intrinsic mechanism that requires canonical bitter receptors. A single receptor complex likely generates both ON and OFF responses to a given bitter ligand. These ON and OFF responses in the periphery are propagated to dopaminergic neurons that mediate aversive learning, and the presence of the OFF response impacts synaptic plasticity when bitter is used as a reinforcement cue. These studies reveal previously unknown features of taste responses that impact neural circuit function and may be important for behavior. Moreover, these studies show that OFF responses can dramatically influence timing-based synaptic plasticity, which is thought to underlie associative learning.',\n",

Yet how these changes influence the neuronal computations necessary for normal brain function are not well understood. To identify cellular mechanisms underlying the maturation of synaptic integration in interneurons, we combined patch-clamp recordings of excitatory inputs in mouse cerebellar stellate cells (SCs), three-dimensional reconstruction of SC morphology with excitatory synapse location, and biophysical modeling. We found that postnatal maturation of postsynaptic strength was homogeneously reduced along the somatodendritic axis, but dendritic integration was always sublinear. However, dendritic branching increased without changes in synapse density, leading to a substantial gain in distal inputs. Thus, changes in synapse distribution, rather than dendrite cable properties, are the dominant mechanism underlying the maturation of neuronal computation. These mechanisms favor the emergence of a spatially compartmentalized two-stage integration model promoting location-dependent integration within dendritic subunits.',\n",

The synapse presents a dynamic, confined microenvironment in which to explore how key molecules travel, localize, interact and assume different levels of organizational complexity, thereby affecting neuronal function. However, owing to their small size and the diffraction-limited resolution of conventional light microscopic approaches, investigating synaptic structure and dynamics has been challenging. Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) techniques have overcome the resolution barrier and are revolutionizing our quantitative understanding of biological systems in unprecedented spatio-temporal detail. Here we review critical new insights provided by SRM into the molecular architecture and dynamic organization of the synapse and, in particular, the interactions between Aβ and tau in this compartment. We further highlight how SRM can transform our understanding of the molecular pathological mechanisms that underlie AD. The application of SRM for understanding the roles of synapses in AD pathology will provide a stepping stone towards a broader understanding of dysfunction in other subcellular compartments and at cellular and circuit levels in this disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).',\n",

Still, the connectivity patterns between most neuronal types remain mostly unknown. This gap in knowledge underscores the critical need for effective neural circuit mapping tools, especially ones that can integrate structural and functional analyses. To address this, we previously developed a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) based approach called Tracer with Restricted Anterograde Spread (TRAS). TRAS utilizes lentivirus to complement replication-incompetent VSV (VSVΔG) to allow restricted (monosynaptic) anterograde labeling from projection neurons to their target cells in the brain. Here, we report the second generation of TRAS (TRAS-M51R), which utilizes a mutant variant of VSVΔG [VSV(M51R)ΔG] with reduced cytotoxicity. Within the primary visual pathway, we found that TRAS-M51R significantly improved long-term viability of transsynaptic labeling (compared to TRAS) while maintaining anterograde spread activity. By using Cre-expressing VSV(M51R)ΔG, TRAS-M51R could selectively label excitatory ( positive) and inhibitory ( positive) retinorecipient neurons. We further show that these labeled excitatory and inhibitory retinorecipient neurons retained neuronal excitability upon visual stimulation at 5-8 days post fertilization (2-5 days post-infection). Together, these findings show that TRAS-M51R is suitable for neural circuit studies that integrate structural connectivity, cell-type identity, and neurophysiology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cocaine-associated environments (i.e., contexts) evoke persistent memories of cocaine reward and thereby contribute to the maintenance of addictive behavior in cocaine users. From a therapeutic perspective, enhancing inhibitory control over cocaine-conditioned responses is of pivotal importance but requires a more detailed understanding of the neural circuitry that can suppress context-evoked cocaine memories, e.g., through extinction learning. The ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) are thought to bidirectionally regulate responding to cocaine cues through their projections to other brain regions. However, whether these mPFC subregions interact to enable adaptive responding to cocaine-associated contextual stimuli has remained elusive. We used antero- and retrograde tracing combined with chemogenetic intervention to examine the role of vmPFC-to-dmPFC projections in extinction of cocaine-induced place preference in mice. In addition, electrophysiological recordings and optogenetics were used to determine whether parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the dmPFC are innervated by vmPFC projections. We found that vmPFC-to-dmPFC projecting neurons are activated during unreinforced re-exposure to a cocaine-associated context, and selective suppression of these cells impairs extinction learning. Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in the dmPFC receive stronger monosynaptic excitatory input from vmPFC projections than local dmPFC pyramidal neurons, consequently resulting in disynaptic inhibition of pyramidal neurons. In line with this, we show that chemogenetic suppression of dmPFC parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons impairs extinction learning. Our data reveal that vmPFC projections mediate extinction of a cocaine-associated contextual memory through recruitment of feed-forward inhibition in the dmPFC, thereby providing a novel neuronal substrate that promotes extinction-induced inhibitory control.

Multielectrode arrays provide a way of non-destructive analysis of spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity, allowing to model neurodegenerative diseases in vitro. Here, we provide an overview on how these devices are currently used in research on the amyloid-β peptide and its role in Alzheimer's disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Most of the studies analysed here indicate fast responses of neuronal cultures towards aggregated forms of amyloid-β, leading to increases of spike frequency and impairments of long-term potentiation. This in turn suggests that this peptide might play a crucial role in causing the typical neuronal dysfunction observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Although the number of studies using multielectrode arrays to examine the effect of the amyloid-β peptide onto neural cultures or whole compartments is currently limited, they still show how this technique can be used to not only investigate the interneuronal communication in neural networks, but also making it possible to examine the effects onto synaptic currents.

       "  'abstract': 'Nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco, has bivalent rewarding and aversive properties. Recently, the lateral habenula (LHb), a structure that controls ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) function, has attracted attention as it is potentially involved in the aversive properties of drugs of abuse. Hitherto, the LHb-modulation of nicotine-induced VTA neuronal activity in vivo is unknown. Using standard single-extracellular recording in anesthetized rats, we observed that intravenous administration of nicotine hydrogen tartrate (25-800\\xa0μg/kg i.v.) caused a dose-dependent increase in the basal firing rate of the LHb neurons of nicotine-naïve rats. This effect underwent complete desensitization in chronic nicotine (6\\xa0mg/kg/day for 14 days)-treated animals. As previously reported, acute nicotine induced an increase in the VTA DA neuronal firing rate. Interestingly, only neurons located medially (mVTA) but not laterally (latVTA) within the VTA were responsive to acute nicotine. This pattern of activation was reversed by chronic nicotine exposure which produced the selective increase of latVTA neuronal activity. Acute lesion of the LHb, similarly to chronic nicotine treatment, reversed the pattern of DA cell activation induced by acute nicotine increasing latVTA but not mVTA neuronal activity. Our evidence indicates that LHb plays an important role in mediating the effects of acute and chronic nicotine within the VTA by activating distinct subregional responses of DA neurons. The LHb/VTA modulation might be part of the neural substrate of nicotine aversive properties. By silencing the LHb chronic nicotine could shift the balance of motivational states toward the reward.',\n",

Mechanistically, olfactory learning promoted PV interneuron excitatory synaptic plasticity and direct binding of ErbB4 with presynaptic Neurexin1β (NRXN1β) and postsynaptic scaffold PSD-95 in the prefrontal cortex. Interrupting ErbB4-NRXN1β interaction impaired network activity-driven excitatory inputs and excitatory synaptic transmission onto PV interneurons. Neuronal activity-induced ErbB4-PSD-95 association facilitated transsynaptic binding of ErbB4-NRXN1β and excitatory synapse formation in ErbB4-positive interneurons. Furthermore, ErbB4-NRXN1β binding was responsible for the activity-regulated activation of ErbB4 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in PV interneurons, as well as synaptic plasticity-related expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Correlatedly, blocking ErbB4-NRXN1β coupling in the medial prefrontal cortex of adult mice facilitated reversal learning of an olfactory associative task. These findings provide novel insight into the physiological role of PV interneuron ErbB4 signaling in cognitive processes and reveal an associative learning-related transsynaptic NRXN1β-ErbB4-PSD-95 complex that affects the ERK1/2-BDNF pathway and underlies local inhibitory circuit plasticity and proactive interference.',\n",

Hemorrhagic hypotension leads to chemoreceptor anoxia, which consequently results in the reduction of baroreceptor discharge and stimulation of the chemoreceptor. Using the single-unit recording technique, the neuronal activities of the cuneiform nucleus were investigated in hypotensive states induced by hemorrhage and administration of an anti-hypertensive drug (hydralazine). Thirty male rats were divided into the control, hemorrhage, and hydralazine groups. The femoral artery was cannulated for the recording of cardiovascular responses, including systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate. Hydralazine was administered via tail vein. The single-unit recording was performed from the cuneiform nucleus. The maximal systolic blood pressure and the mean arterial pressure significantly decreased and heart rate significantly increased after the application of hydralazine as well as the following hemorrhage compared to the control group. Hypotension significantly increased the firing rate of the cuneiform nucleus in both the hemorrhage and hydralazine groups compared to the control group. The present data indicate that the cuneiform nucleus activities following hypotension may play a crucial role in blood vessels and vasomotor tone. ',\n",

We show that, during a visual task requiring spatial attention directed by an auditory cue, an inferior-superior colliculus circuit provides the key attention signal. In mice performing a task based on a visual stimulus in the cued hemifield while ignoring a conflicting stimulus on the uncued side, the visual cortex (V1) and superior colliculus (SC) showed strong attentional modulation, with a shorter latency in the SC. The nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus (nBIC), which provides auditory inputs to the SC, was activated not only at auditory cue onset but also during the delay period before the visual stimulus. The delay activity, but not cue onset activity, was crucial for task performance and attentional modulation in the SC and V1.

Astrocytes also express NMDARs, although their exact function has remained controversial. Here, we identify in mouse hippocampus, a circuit function for GluN2C NMDAR, a subtype highly expressed in astrocytes, in layer-specific tuning of synaptic strengths in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Interfering with astrocyte NMDAR or GluN2C NMDAR activity reduces the range of presynaptic strength distribution specifically in the  inputs without an appreciable change in the mean presynaptic strength. Mathematical modeling shows that narrowing of the width of presynaptic release probability distribution compromises the expression of long-term synaptic plasticity.

       "  'abstract': 'Chemical synapses provide a vital foundation for neuron-neuron communication and overall brain function. By tethering closely apposed molecular machinery for presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic signal transduction, circuit- and context- specific synaptic properties can drive neuronal computations for animal behavior. Trans-synaptic signaling via synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) serves as a promising mechanism to generate the molecular diversity of chemical synapses. Neuroligins (Nlgns) were discovered as postsynaptic CAMs that can bind to presynaptic CAMs like Neurexins (Nrxns) at the synaptic cleft. Among the four (Nlgn1-4) or five (Nlgn1-3, Nlgn4X, and Nlgn4Y) isoforms in rodents or humans, respectively, Nlgn3 has a heterogeneous expression and function at particular subsets of chemical synapses and strong association with non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Several lines of evidence have suggested that the unique expression and function of Nlgn3 protein underlie circuit-specific dysfunction characteristic of non-syndromic ASD caused by the disruption of Nlgn3 gene. Furthermore, recent studies have uncovered the molecular mechanism underlying input cell-dependent expression of Nlgn3 protein at hippocampal inhibitory synapses, in which trans-synaptic signaling of specific alternatively spliced isoforms of Nlgn3 and Nrxn plays a critical role. In this review article, we overview the molecular, anatomical, and physiological knowledge about Nlgn3, focusing on the circuit-specific function of mammalian Nlgn3 and its underlying molecular mechanism. This will provide not only new insight into specific Nlgn3-mediated trans-synaptic interactions as molecular codes for synapse specification but also a better understanding of the pathophysiological basis for non-syndromic ASD associated with functional impairment in Nlgn3 gene.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chronic social isolation stress (SIS) induces lasting negative effects on the brain, including memory deficits, cognitive impairments, and mood alterations such as depression and anxiety. All these symptoms, at least in part, reflect reduced hippocampal function. In both clinical and preclinical studies, subanesthetic doses of the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine (KET), was shown to have rapid and lasting antidepressant effects. Animal studies have shown that biological sex and levels of gonadal hormones alter the behavioral effects of KET, with ovarian hormones increasing sensitivity to the antidepressant-like effects of KET. Since the hippocampus plays a key role in mediating some of the effects of SIS, and considering that KET at low doses has been shown to rescue some of the behavioral deficits of isolation rearing this study aimed to assess the effects of isolation stress on pre- and post-synaptic hippocampal functions in male and female rats reared in SIS, as well as determine whether some of the physiological deficits can be rescued with a single injection of sub-anesthetic doses of KET. To do this, Sprague-Dawley rats were raised from weaning in either social isolation or with same-sex cage mate for 5 to 7\\xa0weeks. Male and female rats in either diestrus of proestrus received a single injection of KET (0, 2.5, or 5.0\\xa0mg/kg) three hours prior to termination and collection of acute hippocampal slices for ex vivo electrophysiological field potential recordings. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and paired pulse facilitation (PPF) outputs were assessed in a canonical CA3-CA1 dorsal hippocampal circuit. Our data show that SIS inhibits hippocampal LTP without affecting PPF in male rats, an effect that was rescued by KET. In female rats, isolation stress did not alter LTP, but did reduce PPF - especially when females were tested in diestrus-, an effect that was rescued by KET at the highest dose. Our data thus suggest sex differences in the contribution of pre-and postsynaptic hippocampal compartments in response to stress and KET.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the neural circuit formation, neuronal growth cones must be guided precisely to their neuronal or muscle targets, which can be achieved by the activation of membrane-bound guidance receptors at the periphery. However, the mechanisms that regulate the temporal availability of these receptors remain largely unknown. TAR DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) has been proposed to bind with the mRNAs of guidance receptors, thus prompting us to investigate its role in axon guidance of the spinal lateral motor column (LMC) neurons into the limb mesenchyme. We first identified the TDP-43 expression in the LMC neurons at the stage of axons growth into the limb using in situ mRNA hybridization. The loss and gain of TDP-43 function in chick LMC neurons redirected their axon trajectory with opposite effects. In mice, a spinal motor neuron-specific TDP-43 deletion led to the misrouting of LMC axons. Further, ectopic TDP-43 expression increased EphB protein levels in LMC neurons, suggesting that TDP-43 mediates LMC pathfinding by regulating EphB expression. Finally, TDP-43 levels influenced the growth preference of LMC neurites against ephrin-B, but not Netrin-1 and Semaphorin ligands. Our results demonstrate that TDP-43 is essential for the ephrinB:EphB signaling-mediated axon trajectory selection of LMC subtypes into the limb.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Homeostatic plasticity maintains network stability by adjusting excitation, inhibition, or the intrinsic excitability of neurons, but the developmental regulation and coordination of these distinct forms of homeostatic plasticity remains poorly understood. A major contributor to this information gap is the lack of a uniform paradigm for chronically manipulating activity at different developmental stages. To overcome this limitation, we used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to directly suppress neuronal activity in layer2/3 (L2/3) of mouse primary visual cortex of either sex at two important developmental timepoints: the classic visual system critical period [CP; postnatal day 24 (P24) to P29], and adulthood (P45 to P55). We show that 24 h of DREADD-mediated activity suppression simultaneously induces excitatory synaptic scaling up and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons during the CP, consistent with previous observations using prolonged visual deprivation. Importantly, manipulations known to block these forms of homeostatic plasticity when induced pharmacologically or via visual deprivation also prevented DREADD-induced homeostatic plasticity. We next used the same paradigm to suppress activity in adult animals. Surprisingly, while excitatory synaptic scaling persisted into adulthood, intrinsic homeostatic plasticity was completely absent. Finally, we found that homeostatic changes in quantal inhibitory input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons were absent during the CP but were present in adults. Thus, the same population of neurons can express distinct sets of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms at different development stages. Our findings suggest that homeostatic forms of plasticity can be recruited in a modular manner according to the evolving needs of a developing neural circuit. Developing brain circuits are subject to dramatic changes in inputs that could destabilize activity if left uncompensated. This compensation is achieved through a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that provide slow, negative feedback adjustments to excitability. Given that circuits are subject to very different destabilizing forces during distinct developmental stages, the forms of homeostatic plasticity present in the network must be tuned to these evolving needs. Here we developed a method to induce comparable homeostatic compensation during distinct developmental windows and found that neurons in the juvenile and mature brain engage strikingly different forms of homeostatic plasticity. Thus, homeostatic mechanisms can be recruited in a modular manner according to the developmental needs of the circuit.',\n",

We investigate the occurrence of developmental abnormalities in dopaminergic neurons in a model of Parkinson's disease (PD). We monitor the differentiation of human patient-specific neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) into dopaminergic neurons. Using high-throughput image analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing, we observe that the PD-associated LRRK2-G2019S mutation alters the initial phase of neuronal differentiation by accelerating cell-cycle exit with a concomitant increase in cell death. We identify the NESC-specific core regulatory circuit and a molecular mechanism underlying the observed phenotypes. The expression of NR2F1, a key transcription factor involved in neurogenesis, decreases in LRRK2-G2019S NESCs, neurons, and midbrain organoids compared to controls.

       "  'abstract': 'Macrophages maintain tissue homeostasis by phagocytosing and removing unwanted materials such as dead cells and cell debris. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are no exception. In addition, a series of recent studies have shown that microglia phagocytose the neuronal synapses that form the basis of neural circuit function. This discovery has spurred many neuroscientists to study microglia. Importantly, in the CNS parenchyma, not only microglia but also blood-derived monocytes, which essentially differentiate into macrophages after infiltration, exert phagocytic ability, making the study of phagocytosis in the CNS even more interesting and complex. In particular, in the diseased brain, the phagocytosis of tissue-damaging substances, such as myelin debris in multiple sclerosis (MS), has been shown to be carried out by both microglia and blood-derived monocytes. However, it remains largely unclear why blood-derived monocytes need to invade the parenchyma, where microglia are already abundant, to assist in phagocytosis. We will also discuss whether this phagocytosis can affect the fate of the phagocytosing cell itself as well as the substance being phagocytosed and the surrounding environment in addition to future research directions. In this review, we will introduce recent studies to answer a question that often arises when studying microglial phagocytosis: under what circumstances and to what extent blood-derived monocytes infiltrate the CNS and contribute to phagocytosis. In addition, the readers will learn how recent studies have experimentally distinguished between microglia and infiltrating monocytes. Finally, we aim to contribute to the progress of phagocytosis research by discussing the effects of phagocytosis on phagocytic cells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Astrocytes are complex glial cells that play many essential roles in the brain, including the fine-tuning of synaptic activity and blood flow. These roles are linked to fluctuations in intracellular Ca within astrocytes. Recent advances in imaging techniques have identified localized Ca transients within the fine processes of the astrocytic structure, which we term microdomain Ca events. These Ca transients are very diverse and occur under different conditions, including in the presence or absence of surrounding circuit activity. This complexity suggests that different signalling mechanisms mediate microdomain events which may then encode specific astrocyte functions from the modulation of synapses up to brain circuits and behaviour. Several recent studies have shown that a subset of astrocyte microdomain Ca events occur rapidly following local neuronal circuit activity. In this review, we consider the physiological relevance of microdomain astrocyte Ca signalling within brain circuits and outline possible pathways of extracellular Ca influx through ionotropic receptors and other Ca ion channels, which may contribute to astrocyte microdomain events with potentially fast dynamics.',\n",

However, a causal relationship between alpha-synucleinopathy and Parkinsonian neurodegeneration has not been delineated. Rats were chronically treated with rotenone and EEG and EMG signals were recorded for analysis of sleep behavior, assisted by video recording of body movements. C-fos expression and TUNEL staining were used to assess neuronal activation and apoptosis, respectively. Chemogenetic manipulation of brain stem nuclei was conducted to ameliorate RBD symptoms in rotenone-treated rats. Rats chronically exposed to rotenone exhibited progressive RBD features, from EEG slowing to REM sleep motor behavior and NREM muscle activities. Temporally, these phenomena correlated well with progressive alpha-synuclein aggregation and neuronal apoptosis in the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD) and gigantocellular ventricular reticular nucleus in the brainstem. Chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic neurons in SLD alleviated RBD symptoms in the rotenone model. Taken together, these results are consistent with a progressive degeneration in the REM sleep promoting and atonia circuit in early Parkinsonism that underlies the emergence of RBD symptoms, and demonstrate that the rotenone model is useful for further studies into RBD and its relationship to PD. \",\n",

Although substantial studies suggest that Fru specifies a neuronal circuitry governing all aspects of male sexual behaviors, recent findings show that Fru is not absolutely necessary for such behaviors. We propose that another regulatory gene doublesex encoding the male-specific Dsx protein builds a core neuronal circuitry that possesses the potential for courtship, which could be either induced through adult social experience or innately manifested during development by Fru expression in a broader neuronal circuitry. Fru expression levels and patterns determine the modes of courtship behavior from innate heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, to learned courtship. We discuss how Fru expression is regulated by hormones and social experiences and tunes functional flexibility of the sex circuitry. We propose that regulatory genes hierarchically build the potential for innate and learned aspects of courtship behaviors, and expression changes of these regulatory genes among different individuals and species with different social experiences ultimately lead to behavioral diversification.',\n",

Specifically, recombinant one-step rabies viruses (RABV) have been instrumental in the widespread application of viral circuit mapping, as these viruses have enabled labs to map the direct inputs onto defined cell populations. Within the neuroscience community, it is widely believed that RABV spreads directly between neurons  synaptic connections, a hypothesis based principally on two observations. First, the virus labels neurons in a pattern consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Second, few glial cells appear to be infected following RABV injections, despite the fact that glial cells are abundant in the brain. However, there is no direct evidence that RABV can actually be transmitted through synaptic connections. Here we review the immunosubversive mechanisms that are critical to RABV's success for infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS). These include interfering with and ultimately killing migratory T cells while maintaining levels of interferon (IFN) signaling in the brain parenchyma. Finally, we critically evaluate studies that support or are against synaptically-restricted RABV transmission and the implications of viral-host immune responses for RABV transmission in the brain.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the hippocampal circuit CA3 input plays a critical role in the organization of CA1 population activity, both during learning and sleep. While integrated spatial representations have been observed across the two hemispheres of CA1, these regions lack direct connectivity and thus the circuitry responsible remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the role of CA3 in organizing bilateral CA1 activity by blocking synaptic transmission at CA3 terminals through the inducible transgenic expression of tetanus toxin. Although the properties of single place cells in CA1 were comparable bilaterally, we find a decrease of ripple synchronization between left and right CA1 after silencing CA3. Further, during both exploration and rest, CA1 neuronal ensemble activity is less coordinated across hemispheres. This included degradation of the replay of previously explored spatial paths in CA1 during rest, consistent with the idea that CA3 bilateral projections integrate activity between left and right hemispheres and orchestrate bilateral hippocampal coding.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Female reproductive behaviors and physiology change profoundly after mating. The control of pregnancy-associated changes in physiology and behaviors are largely hard-wired into the brain to guarantee reproductive success, yet the gene expression programs that direct neuronal differentiation and circuit wiring at the end of the sex determination pathway in response to mating are largely unknown. In Drosophila, the post-mating response induced by male-derived sex-peptide in females is a well-established model to elucidate how complex innate behaviors are hard-wired into the brain. Here, we use a genetic approach to further characterize the molecular and cellular architecture of the sex-peptide response in Drosophila females. Screening for mutations that affect the sensitivity to sex-peptide, we identified the channel nuclear pore protein Nup54 gene as an essential component for mediating the sex-peptide response, with viable mutant alleles leading to the inability of laying eggs and reducing receptivity upon sex-peptide exposure. Nup54 directs correct wiring of eight adult brain neurons that express pickpocket and are required for egg-laying, while additional channel Nups also mediate sexual differentiation. Consistent with links of Nups to speciation, the Nup54 promoter is a hot spot for rapid evolution and promoter variants alter nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. These results implicate nuclear pore functionality to neuronal wiring underlying the sex-peptide response and sexual differentiation as a response to sexual conflict arising from male-derived sex-peptide to direct the female post-mating response.

       "  'abstract': 'The neuropilin receptors and their secreted semaphorin ligands play key roles in brain circuit development by regulating numerous crucial neuronal processes, including the maturation of synapses and migration of GABAergic interneurons. Consistent with its developmental roles, the neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) locus contains polymorphisms in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Nrp2-deficient mice show autism-like behavioral deficits and propensity to develop seizures. In order to determine the pathophysiology in Nrp2 deficiency, we examined the hippocampal numbers of interneuron subtypes and inhibitory regulation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in mice lacking one or both copies of Nrp2. Immunostaining for interneuron subtypes revealed that Nrp2 mice have a reduced number of parvalbumin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y cells, mainly in CA1. Whole-cell recordings identified reduced firing and hyperpolarized shift in resting membrane potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons from Nrp2 and Nrp2 mice compared to age-matched wild-type controls indicating decrease in intrinsic excitability. Simultaneously, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) are reduced in Nrp2-deficient mice. A convulsive dose of kainic acid evoked electrographic and behavioral seizures with significantly shorter latency, longer duration, and higher severity in Nrp2 compared to Nrp2 animals. Finally, Nrp2 and Nrp2 but not Nrp2, mice have impaired cognitive flexibility demonstrated by reward-based reversal learning, a task associated with hippocampal circuit function. Together these data demonstrate a broad reduction in interneuron subtypes and compromised inhibition in CA1 of Nrp2 mice, which could contribute to the heightened seizure susceptibility and behavioral deficits consistent with an ASD/epilepsy phenotype.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The brain adapts to the sensory environment. For example, simple sensory exposure can modify the response properties of early sensory neurons. How these changes affect the overall encoding and maintenance of stimulus information across neuronal populations remains unclear. We perform parallel recordings in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized cats and find that brief, repetitive exposure to structured visual stimuli enhances stimulus encoding by decreasing the selectivity and increasing the range of the neuronal responses that persist after stimulus presentation. Low-dimensional projection methods and simple classifiers demonstrate that visual exposure increases the segregation of persistent neuronal population responses into stimulus-specific clusters. These observed refinements preserve the representational details required for stimulus reconstruction and are detectable in postexposure spontaneous activity. Assuming response facilitation and recurrent network interactions as the core mechanisms underlying stimulus persistence, we show that the exposure-driven segregation of stimulus responses can arise through strictly local plasticity mechanisms, also in the absence of firing rate changes. Our findings provide evidence for the existence of an automatic, unguided optimization process that enhances the encoding power of neuronal populations in early visual cortex, thus potentially benefiting simple readouts at higher stages of visual processing.',\n",

CDKL5 has been implicated in neuronal synapse maturation, yet its postdevelopmental necessity and the reversibility of CDD-associated impairments remain unknown. We temporally manipulated endogenous Cdkl5 expression in male mice and found that postdevelopmental loss of CDKL5 disrupts numerous behavioral domains, hippocampal circuit communication, and dendritic spine morphology, demonstrating an indispensable role for CDKL5 in the adult brain. Accordingly, restoration of Cdkl5 after the early stages of brain development using a conditional rescue mouse model ameliorated CDD-related behavioral impairments and aberrant NMDA receptor signaling. These findings highlight the requirement of CDKL5 beyond early development, underscore the potential for disease reversal in CDD, and suggest that a broad therapeutic time window exists for potential treatment of CDD-related deficits.',\n",

There are several models for neural networks of the human brain, that cover sensory to cortical information processing. Large majority models include feedback mechanisms that are hard to formalise to realistic applications. Recurrent neural networks and Long short-term memory (LSTM) inspire from the neuronal feedback networks. Long short-term memory (LSTM) prevent vanishing and exploding gradients problems faced by simple recurrent neural networks and has the ability to process order-dependent data. Such recurrent neural units can be replicated in hardware and interfaced with analog sensors for efficient and miniaturised implementation of intelligent processing. Implementation of analog memristive LSTM hardware is an open research problem and can offer the advantages of continuous domain analog computing with relatively low on-chip area compared with a digital-only implementation. Designed for solving time-series prediction problems, overall architectures and circuits were tested with TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS technology and hafnium-oxide ( ) based memristor crossbars. Extensive circuit based SPICE simulations with over 3,500 (inference only) and 300 system-level simulations (training and inference) were performed for benchmarking the system performance of the proposed implementations. The analysis includes Monte Carlo simulations for the variability of memristors' conductance, and crossbar parasitic, where non-idealities of hybrid CMOS-memristor circuits are taken into the account.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To understand what makes sleep vulnerable in disease, it is useful to look at how wake-promoting mechanisms affect healthy sleep. Wake-promoting neuronal activity is inhibited during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS). However, sensory vigilance persists in NREMS in animals and humans, suggesting that wake promotion could remain functional. Here, we demonstrate that consolidated mouse NREMS is a brain state with recurrent fluctuations of the wake-promoting neurotransmitter noradrenaline on the ∼50-s timescale in the thalamus. These fluctuations occurred around mean noradrenaline levels greater than the ones of quiet wakefulness, while noradrenaline (NA) levels declined steeply in REMS. They coincided with a clustering of sleep spindle rhythms in the forebrain and with heart-rate variations, both of which are correlates of sensory arousability. We addressed the origins of these fluctuations by using closed-loop optogenetic locus coeruleus (LC) activation or inhibition timed to moments of low and high spindle activity during NREMS. We could suppress, lock, or entrain sleep-spindle clustering and heart-rate variations, suggesting that both fore- and hindbrain-projecting LC neurons show coordinated infraslow activity variations in natural NREMS. Noradrenergic modulation of thalamic, but not cortical, circuits was required for sleep-spindle clustering and involved NA release into primary sensory and reticular thalamic nuclei that activated both α1- and β-adrenergic receptors to cause slowly decaying membrane depolarizations. Noradrenergic signaling by LC constitutes a vigilance-promoting mechanism that renders mammalian NREMS vulnerable to disruption on the close-to-minute timescale through sustaining thalamocortical and autonomic sensory arousability.

This released adenosine triphosphate, which was converted extracellularly to adenosine and thus, through A receptors, activated HCN2-containing cation channels that regulate two aspects of myelinated axon function: excitability of the AIS and speed of action potential propagation.

Neurons in multiple sensory areas respond more strongly to novel in comparison to familiar stimuli. Yet, it remains unclear which circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlie those responses. Here, we show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity of inhibitory-to-excitatory synapses generates novelty responses in a recurrent spiking network model. Inhibitory plasticity increases the inhibition onto excitatory neurons tuned to familiar stimuli, while inhibition for novel stimuli remains low, leading to a network novelty response. The generation of novelty responses does not depend on the periodicity but rather on the distribution of presented stimuli. By including tuning of inhibitory neurons, the network further captures stimulus-specific adaptation. Finally, we suggest that disinhibition can control the amplification of novelty responses. Therefore, inhibitory plasticity provides a flexible, biologically plausible mechanism to detect the novelty of bottom-up stimuli, enabling us to make experimentally testable predictions.',\n",

Neurons, each with their own specific molecular identities, act in concert to perceive and relay these stimuli to drive behavior. Generating behavioral responses requires neurons that have the correct morphological, synaptic, and molecular identities. Transcription factors drive the specific gene expression patterns that define these identities, controlling almost every phenomenon in a cell from development to homeostasis. Therefore, transcription factors play an important role in generating and regulating behavior. Here, we describe the transcription factors, the pathways they regulate, and the neurons that drive chemosensation, mechanosensation, thermosensation, osmolarity sensing, complex, and sex-specific behaviors in the animal model . We also discuss the current limitations in our knowledge, particularly our minimal understanding of how transcription factors contribute to the adaptive behavioral responses that are necessary for organismal survival.',\n",

However, current understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is based primarily on studies in the hippocampus and neocortex, where FXS defects have been corrected by inhibiting group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Here, we observe that activation, rather than inhibition, of mGluRs in the basolateral amygdala reverses impairments in a rat model of FXS. FXS rats exhibit deficient recall of auditory conditioned fear, which is accompanied by a range of in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity. We find presynaptic mGluR5 in the amygdala, activation of which reverses deficient synaptic transmission and plasticity, thereby restoring normal fear learning in FXS rats.

In addition, astrocytes help maintain neuronal homeostasis through neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier maintenance, clearance of metabolites and nonfunctional proteins via the glymphatic system, extracellular potassium buffering, and regulation of synaptic activity. Thus, astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to a myriad of neurological disorders. Indeed, astrocyte dysfunction during development has been implicated in Rett disease, Alexander's disease, epilepsy, and autism, among other disorders. Numerous disease model mice have been established to investigate these diseases, but important preclinical findings on etiology and pathophysiology have not translated into clinical interventions. A multidisciplinary approach is required to elucidate the mechanism of these diseases because astrocyte dysfunction can result in altered neuronal connectivity, morphology, and activity. Recent progress in neuroimaging techniques has enabled noninvasive investigations of brain structure and function at multiple spatiotemporal scales, and these technologies are expected to facilitate the translation of preclinical findings to clinical studies and ultimately to clinical trials. Here, we review recent progress on astrocyte contributions to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders revealed using novel imaging techniques, from microscopy scale to mesoscopic scale.\",\n",

These transformations arise in part through target-specific routing of information; however, within-area computations may also contribute to area-specific function. Here, we sought to determine whether higher order visual cortical areas lateromedial (LM), anterolateral (AL), posteromedial (PM), and anteromedial (AM) have specialized anatomical and physiological properties by using a combination of whole-cell recordings and optogenetic stimulation of primary visual cortex (V1) axons in\\xa0vitro. We discovered area-specific differences in the strength of recruitment of interneurons through feedforward and recurrent pathways, as well as differences in cell-intrinsic properties and interneuron densities. These differences were most striking when comparing across medial and lateral areas, suggesting that these areas have distinct profiles for net excitability and integration of V1 inputs. Thus, cortical areas are not defined simply by the information they receive but also by area-specific circuit properties that enable specialized filtering of these inputs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labeled in Aldh1l1-EGFP mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheathe retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.',\n",

Here, we showed that specific glutamatergic but not GABAergic ZIc neurons regulated these symptoms. ZIc neuronal activation induced time-locked parkinsonian motor symptoms. In mouse models of PD, the ZIc neurons were hyperactive and inhibition of their activity ameliorated the motor deficits. ZIc neurons monosynaptically projected to the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Incerta-nigral circuit activation induced parkinsonian motor symptoms. Together, our findings provide a direct link between the ZIc, its glutamatergic neurons, and parkinsonian motor symptoms for the first time, help to better understand the mechanisms of PD, and supply a new important potential therapeutic target for PD.\",\n",

Here we report a viral vector-delivery optrode (VVD-optrode) system for precise integration of optogenetics and electrophysiology in the brain. Our system consists of flexible microelectrode filaments and fiber optics that are simultaneously self-assembled in a nanoliter-scale, viral vector-delivery polymer carrier. The highly localized delivery and neuronal expression of opsin genes at microelectrode-tissue interfaces ensure high spatial congruence between optogenetically manipulated and electrically recorded neuronal populations.

We used synaptic differences to excite parvalbumin-expressing GPe neurons and inhibit lim-homeobox-6–expressing GPe neurons simultaneously using brief bursts of electrical stimulation.

Efforts to understand the underpinnings of this plasticity have almost exclusively focused on the functional and underlying structural changes that neurons undergo at neurochemical synapses. What has received comparatively little attention is the involvement of activity-dependent myelination in such plasticity and the functional output of circuits controlling behavior. The traditionally held view of myelin as a passive insulator of axons is changing to one of lifelong changes in myelin, modulated by neuronal activity and experience.

This was achieved by coordinated large-scale analyses of single-cell transcriptomes, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylomes, spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes, morphological and electrophysiological properties and cellular resolution input-output mapping, integrated through cross-modal computational analysis. Our results advance the collective knowledge and understanding of brain cell-type organization. First, our study reveals a unified molecular genetic landscape of cortical cell types that integrates their transcriptome, open chromatin and DNA methylation maps. Second, cross-species analysis achieves a consensus taxonomy of transcriptomic types and their hierarchical organization that is conserved from mouse to marmoset and human. Third, in situ single-cell transcriptomics provides a spatially resolved cell-type atlas of the motor cortex. Fourth, cross-modal analysis provides compelling evidence for the transcriptomic, epigenomic and gene regulatory basis of neuronal phenotypes such as their physiological and anatomical properties, demonstrating the biological validity and genomic underpinning of neuron types. We further present an extensive genetic toolset for targeting glutamatergic neuron types towards linking their molecular and developmental identity to their circuit function.

       "  'abstract': 'Social memory-the ability to recognize and remember familiar conspecifics-is critical for the survival of an animal in its social group. The dorsal CA2 (dCA2) and ventral CA1 (vCA1) subregions of the hippocampus, and their projection targets, have important roles in social memory. However, the relevant extrahippocampal input regions remain poorly defined. Here we identify the medial septum (MS) as a dCA2 input region that is critical for social memory and reveal that modulation of the MS by serotonin (5-HT) bidirectionally controls social memory formation, thereby affecting memory stability. Novel social interactions increase activity in dCA2-projecting MS neurons and induce plasticity at glutamatergic synapses from MS neurons onto dCA2 pyramidal neurons. The activity of dCA2-projecting MS cells is enhanced by the neuromodulator 5-HT acting on 5-HT receptors. Moreover, optogenetic manipulation of median raphe 5-HT terminals in the MS bidirectionally regulates social memory stability. This work expands our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which social interactions lead to social memory and provides evidence that 5-HT has a critical role in promoting not only prosocial behaviours, but also social memory, by influencing distinct target structures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The formation of fibrovascular membranes (FVMs) is a serious sight-threatening complication of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) that may result in retinal detachment and eventual blindness. During the formation of these membranes, neurite/process outgrowth occurs in retinal neurons and glial cells, which may both serve as a scaffold and have guiding or regulatory roles. To further understand this process, we investigated whether previously identified candidate proteins, from vitreous of PDR patients with FVMs, could induce neurite outgrowth in an experimental setting. Retinal explants of C57BL6/N mouse pups on postnatal day 3 (P3) were cultured in poly-L-lysine- and laminin-coated dishes. Outgrowth stimulation experiments were performed with the addition of potential inducers of neurite outgrowth. Automated analysis of neurite outgrowth was performed by measuring β-tubulin-immunopositive neurites using Image J. Expression of PDGF receptors was quantified by RT-PCR in FVMs of PDR patients. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner, whilst neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) did not. When comparing three different PDGF dimers, treatment with PDGF-AB resulted in the highest neurite induction, followed by PDGF-AA and -BB. In addition, incubation of retinal explants with vitreous from PDR patients resulted in a significant induction of neurite outgrowth as compared to non-diabetic control vitreous from patients with macular holes, which could be prevented by addition of CP673451, a potent PDGF receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor. Abundant expression of PDGF receptors was detected in FVMs. Our findings suggest that PDGF may be involved in the retinal neurite outgrowth, which is associated with the formation of FVMs in PDR.

       "  'abstract': 'Fear learning and memory are crucial for animal survival. Abnormal fear memory is a hallmark of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Appropriate neuronal activation and excitability in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are necessary for the formation of fear memory. The gene  (), which encodes a lysine-63 deubiquitinase, is expressed in several brain regions including the amygdala. The functions of the  protein (CYLD) in the regulation of the neuronal activity, neural circuits and fear memory, remain largely unknown, however. Here, we report that  knockout impairs amygdala-dependent tone-cued fear memory. The number of c-Fos neurons responding to the tone-cued fear test was reduced in the BLA of   mice, suggesting that the absence of CYLD causes aberrant neuronal activation. We found that this aberrant neuronal activation in the BLA of   mice may relate to the decreased excitability of principal neurons. Another possibility of aberrant neuronal activation could be the impaired excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA of   mice. Specifically, both the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in BLA principal neurons were decreased. In addition,  mutation caused an increase in both the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in principal neurons and the number of parvalbumin interneurons, consistent with excessive local circuit inhibition in the BLA of   mice. Taken together, these results suggest that CYLD deficiency disrupts the neuronal activity and synaptic transmission in the BLA of mice which may contribute to the impaired fear memory observed in   mice.',\n",

In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the Xenopus laevis tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the Xenopus retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in Xenopus, we identified an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterize the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Signals from the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), must be decoded to generate daily rhythms in hormone release. Here, we hypothesized that the SCN entrains rhythms in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to time the daily release of corticosterone. In vivo recording revealed a critical circuit from SCN vasoactive intestinal peptide (SCN)-producing neurons to PVN corticotropin-releasing hormone (PVN)-producing neurons. PVN neurons peak in clock gene expression around midday and in calcium activity about three hours later. Loss of the clock gene Bmal1 in CRH neurons results in arrhythmic PVN calcium activity and dramatically reduces the amplitude and precision of daily corticosterone release. SCN activation reduces (and inactivation increases) corticosterone release and PVN calcium activity, and daily SCN activation entrains PVN clock gene rhythms by inhibiting PVN neurons. We conclude that daily corticosterone release depends on coordinated clock gene and neuronal activity rhythms in both SCN and PVN neurons.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Glia in the central nervous system exert precise spatial and temporal regulation over neural circuitry on a synapse-specific basis, but it is unclear if peripheral glia share this exquisite capacity to sense and modulate circuit activity. In the enteric nervous system (ENS), glia control gastrointestinal motility through bidirectional communication with surrounding neurons. We combined glial chemogenetics with genetically encoded calcium indicators expressed in enteric neurons and glia to study network-level activity in the intact myenteric plexus of the proximal colon. Stimulation of neural fiber tracts projecting in aboral, oral, and circumferential directions activated distinct populations of enteric glia. The majority of glia responded to both oral and aboral stimulation and circumferential pathways, while smaller subpopulations were activated only by ascending and descending pathways. Cholinergic signaling functionally specifies glia to the descending circuitry, and this network plays an important role in repressing the activity of descending neural pathways, with some degree of cross-inhibition imposed upon the ascending pathway. Glial recruitment by purinergic signaling functions to enhance activity within ascending circuit pathways and constrain activity within descending networks. Pharmacological manipulation of glial purinergic and cholinergic signaling differentially altered neuronal responses in these circuits in a sex-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings establish that the balance between purinergic and cholinergic signaling may differentially control specific circuit activity through selective signaling between networks of enteric neurons and glia. Thus, enteric glia regulate the ENS circuitry in a network-specific manner, providing profound insights into the functional breadth and versatility of peripheral glia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The cerebellum is a conserved structure of vertebrate brains that develops at the most anterior region of the alar rhombencephalon. All vertebrates display a cerebellum, making it one of the most highly conserved structures of the brain. Although it greatly varies at the morphological level, several lines of research point to strong conservation of its internal neural circuitry. To test the conservation of the cerebellar circuit, we compared the developmental history of the neurons comprising this circuit in three amniote species: mouse, chick, and gecko. We specifically researched the developmental time of generation of the main neuronal types of the cerebellar cortex. This developmental trajectory is known for the mammalian cell types but barely understood for sauropsid species. We show that the neurogenesis of the GABAergic lineage proceeds following the same chronological sequence in the three species compared: Purkinje cells are the first ones generated in the cerebellar cortex, followed by Golgi interneurons of the granule cell layer, and lately by the interneurons of the molecular layer. In the cerebellar glutamatergic lineage, we observed the same conservation of neurogenesis throughout amniotes, and the same vastly prolonged neurogenesis of granule cells, extending much further than for any other brain region. Together these data show that the cerebellar circuitry develops following a tightly conserved chronological sequence of neurogenesis, which is responsible for the preservation of the cerebellum and its function. Our data reinforce the developmental perspective of homology, whereby similarities in neurons and circuits are likely due to similarities in developmental sequence.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ample evidence indicates that in several mammalian species the pineal body contains neurons. In adult white albino rats neurons are not present in the pineal body; however, in perinatal rats many neurons were described. It was demonstrated that in adult mammalian species the pineal neurons contained some neuropeptides and neurotransmitters such as leu-enkephalin, met-enkephalin, substance-P, somatostatin and γ-aminobutiric acid. Oxytocin, vasopressin mRNAs and peptides were also demonstrated. No data are available on the chemical nature of the neurons in perinatal rats. In the present experiment we used immunohistochemistry to clarify this issue. After paraformaldehyde fixation frozen sections were prepared and stained for immunoreactivities of several neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. Dopamine β-hydroxylase, neuropeptide-Y, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, vesicular glutamate transporter and calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies were able to stain fibers. According to previous data these fibers may be sympathetic, parasympathetic or sensory. Vesicular glutamate transporter antibody may stain pinealocytes as well. Some cells were immunoreactive for substance-P, oxytocin, vasopressin, leu-enkefalin and glutamic acid decarboxylase. These immnoreactivities showed colocalization with neuron-specific nuclear protein immunoreactivity indicating that these cells were neurons. Calbindin was observed in oval and elongated cells resembling pinealocytes. Based on the results obtained in adult mammals, the pineal neurons may be analogue to retinal ganglion cells, or they may function as interneurons in the retino-pinealo-retinal neuronal circuit or peptidergic neurons may influence pinealocytes in a paracrine manner.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, which perform beneficial physiological roles across life. These immune cells actively maintain CNS health by clearing toxic debris and removing dysfunctional or degenerating cells. They also modify the wiring of neuronal circuits, by acting on the formation, modification, and elimination of synapses-the connections between neurons. Microglia furthermore recently emerged as highly diverse cells comprising several structural and functional states, indicating a far more critical involvement in orchestrating brain development, plasticity, behaviour, and cognition. Various environmental factors, together with the individual genetic predispositions, confer an increased risk for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as neurodegenerative diseases that include autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, across life. Microglia are highly sensitive to chronic psychological stress, inadequate diet, viral/bacterial infection, pollution, and insufficient or altered sleep, especially during critical developmental periods, but also throughout life. These environmental challenges can compromise microglial physiological functions, resulting notably in defective neuronal circuit wiring, altered brain functional connectivity, and the onset of behavioral deficits into adolescence, adulthood, and aging. This short review provides a historical and technical perspective, notably focused on my contribution to the field, on how environmental challenges affect microglia, particularly their physiological functions, and increase their diversity, which provides novel targets for intervention.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During metamorphosis, the olfactory system of anuran tadpoles undergoes substantial restructuring. The main olfactory epithelium in the principal nasal cavity of Xenopus laevis tadpoles is associated with aquatic olfaction and transformed into the adult air-nose, while a new adult water-nose emerges in the middle cavity. Impacts of this metamorphic remodeling on odor processing, behavior, and network structure are still unexplored. Here, we used neuronal tracings, calcium imaging, and behavioral experiments to examine the functional connectivity between the epithelium and the main olfactory bulb during metamorphosis. In tadpoles, olfactory receptor neurons in the principal cavity project axons to glomeruli in the ventral main olfactory bulb. These projections are gradually replaced by receptor neuron axons from the newly forming middle cavity epithelium. Despite this reorganization in the ventral bulb, two spatially segregated odor processing streams remain undisrupted and behavioral responses to waterborne odorants are unchanged. Contemporaneously, new receptor neurons in the remodeling principal cavity innervate the emerging dorsal part of the bulb, which displays distinct wiring features. Glomeruli around its midline are innervated from the left and right nasal epithelia. Additionally, postsynaptic projection neurons in the dorsal bulb predominantly connect to multiple glomeruli, while half of projection neurons in the ventral bulb are uni-glomerular. Our results show that the \"water system\" remains functional despite metamorphic reconstruction. The network differences between the dorsal and ventral olfactory bulb imply a higher degree of odor integration in the dorsal main olfactory bulb. This is possibly connected with the processing of different odorants, airborne vs. waterborne.',\n",

Neural probes are in vivo invasive devices that integrate sensors and stimulation sites to record and manipulate neuronal activity with high spatiotemporal resolution. State-of-the-art probes are limited by tradeoffs involving their lateral dimension, number of sensors, and ability to access independent stimulation sites. Here, we realize a highly scalable probe that features three-dimensional integration of small-footprint arrays of sensors and nanophotonic circuits to scale the density of sensors per cross-section by one order of magnitude with respect to state-of-the-art devices. For the first time, we overcome the spatial limit of the nanophotonic circuit by coupling only one waveguide to numerous optical ring resonators as passive nanophotonic switches. With this strategy, we achieve accurate on-demand light localization while avoiding spatially demanding bundles of waveguides and demonstrate the feasibility with a proof-of-concept device and its scalability towards high-resolution and low-damage neural optoelectrodes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common form of seizures in children. Single short FSs are benign, but FSs lasting longer than 30\\xa0min, termed febrile status epilepticus, may result in neurological sequelae. However, there is little information about an intermediary condition, brief recurrent FSs (RFSs). The goal of this study was to determine the role of RFSs on spatial learning and memory and the properties of spontaneous hippocampal signals. A hippocampus-dependent active avoidance task was used to assess spatial learning and memory in adult rats that underwent experimental RFSs (eRFSs) in early life compared with their littermate controls. Following completion of the task, we utilized high-density laminar probes to measure spontaneous hippocampal CA1 circuit activity under urethane anesthesia, which allowed for the simultaneous recording of input regions in CA1 associated with both CA3 and entorhinal cortex. RFSs did not result in deficits in the active avoidance spatial test, a hippocampus-dependent test of spatial learning and memory. However, in vivo high-density laminar electrode recordings from eRFS rats had significantly altered power and frequency expression of theta and gamma bandwidths as well as signaling efficacy along the CA1\\xa0somatodendritic axis. Thus, although eRFS modified CA1 neuronal input/output dynamics, these alterations were not sufficient to impair active avoidance spatial behavior. These findings indicate that although eRFSs do not result in spatial cognitive deficits in the active avoidance task, recurrent seizures do alter the brain and result in longstanding changes in the temporal organization of the hippocampus.

       "  'abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 40 million people worldwide. The ineffectiveness of the available pharmacological treatments against AD has fostered researchers to focus on alternative strategies to overcome this challenge. Mechanical vibrations delivered in different stimulation modes have been associated with marked improvements in cognitive and physical performance in both demented and non-demented elderly. Some of the mechanical-based stimulation modalities in efforts are earlier whole-body vibration, transcranial ultrasound stimulation with microbubble injection, and more recently, auditory stimulation. However, there is a huge variety of treatment specifications, and in many cases, conflicting results are reported. In this review, a search on Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases was performed, resulting in 37 papers . These studies suggest that mechanical vibrations delivered through different stimulation modes are effective in attenuating many parameters of AD pathology including functional connectivity and neuronal circuit integrity deficits in the brains of AD patients, as well as in subjects with cognitive decline and non-demented older adults. Despite the evolving preclinical and clinical evidence on these therapeutic modalities, their translation into clinical practice is not consolidated yet. Thus, this comprehensive and critical systematic review aims to address the most important gaps in the reviewed protocols and propose optimal regimens for future clinical application.\",\n",

Using scRNA-seq and stringent validations, we reveal here a developmental roadmap for human telencephalic neurons. Both dorsal and ventral telencephalic radial glial cells (RGs) differentiate into neurons via dividing intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs_div) and early postmitotic neuroblasts (eNBs). The transcription factor ASCL1 plays a key role in promoting fate transition from RGs to IPCs_div in both regions. RGs from the regionalized neuroectoderm show heterogeneity, with restricted glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic differentiation potencies. During neurogenesis, IPCs_div gradually exit the cell cycle and branch into sister eNBs to generate distinct neuronal subtypes. Our findings highlight a general RGs-IPCs_div-eNBs developmental scheme for human telencephalic progenitors and support that the major neuronal fates of human telencephalon are predetermined during dorsoventral regionalization with neuronal diversity being further shaped during neurogenesis and neural circuit integration.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Dopaminergic modulation is essential for the control of voluntary movement; however, the role of dopamine in regulating the neural excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) is not well understood. Here, we investigated two modes by which dopamine influences the input/output function of M1 neurons. To test the direct regulation of M1 neurons by dopamine, we performed whole-cell recordings of excitatory neurons and measured excitability before and after local, acute dopamine receptor blockade. We then determined whether chronic depletion of dopaminergic input to the entire motor circuit, via a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, was sufficient to shift M1 neuron excitability. We show that D1 receptor (D1R) and D2R antagonism altered subthreshold and suprathreshold properties of M1 pyramidal neurons in a layer-specific fashion. The effects of D1R antagonism were primarily driven by changes to intrinsic properties, while the excitability shifts following D2R antagonism relied on synaptic transmission. In contrast, chronic depletion of dopamine to the motor circuit with 6-hydroxydopamine induced layer-specific synaptic transmission-dependent shifts in M1 neuron excitability that only partially overlapped with the effects of acute D1R antagonism. These results suggest that while acute and chronic changes in dopamine modulate the input/output function of M1 neurons, the mechanisms engaged are distinct depending on the duration and origin of the manipulation. Our study highlights the broad influence of dopamine on M1 excitability by demonstrating the consequences of local and global dopamine depletion on neuronal input/output function.\",\n",

In addition, the cerebellum exhibits a widespread presence of receptors, including opioid receptors which are known to play a prominent role in synaptic and circuit mechanisms of plasticity associated with drug use and development of addiction to opioids and other drugs of abuse. Further, the presence of perineural nets (PNNs) in the cerebellum which contain proteins known to alter synaptic plasticity could contribute to addiction. The role the cerebellum plays in processes of addiction is likely complex, and could depend on the particular drug of abuse, the pattern of use, and the stage of the user within the addiction cycle.

Here, we employ chemogenetics to transiently silence CA2 pyramidal cells in mice, and we observe that although SWRs still occur, the reactivation of CA1 pyramidal cell ensembles within the events lose both temporal and informational precision. These observations suggest that CA2 activity contributes to the fidelity of experience-dependent hippocampal replay.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A hallmark neuronal correlate of working memory (WM) is stimulus-selective spiking activity of neurons in PFC during mnemonic delays. These observations have motivated an influential computational modeling framework in which WM is supported by persistent activity. Recently, this framework has been challenged by arguments that observed persistent activity may be an artifact of trial-averaging, which potentially masks high variability of delay activity at the single-trial level. In an alternative scenario, WM delay activity could be encoded in bursts of selective neuronal firing which occur intermittently across trials. However, this alternative proposal has not been tested on single-neuron spike-train data. Here, we developed a framework for addressing this issue by characterizing the trial-to-trial variability of neuronal spiking quantified by Fano factor (FF). By building a doubly stochastic Poisson spiking model, we first demonstrated that the burst-coding proposal implies a significant increase in FF positively correlated with firing rate, and thus loss of stability across trials during the delay. Simulation of spiking cortical circuit WM models further confirmed that FF is a sensitive measure that can well dissociate distinct WM mechanisms. We then tested these predictions on datasets of single-neuron recordings from macaque PFC during three WM tasks. In sharp contrast to the burst-coding model predictions, we only found a small fraction of neurons showing increased WM-dependent burstiness, and stability across trials during delay was strengthened in empirical data. Therefore, reduced trial-to-trial variability during delay provides strong constraints on the contribution of single-neuron intermittent bursting to WM maintenance. There are diverging classes of theoretical models explaining how information is maintained in working memory by cortical circuits. In an influential model class, neurons exhibit persistent elevated memorandum-selective firing, whereas a recently developed class of burst-coding models suggests that persistent activity is an artifact of trial-averaging, and spiking is sparse in each single trial, subserved by brief intermittent bursts. However, this alternative picture has not been characterized or tested on empirical spike-train data. Here we combine mathematical analysis, computational model simulation, and experimental data analysis to test empirically these two classes of models and show that the trial-to-trial variability of empirical spike trains is not consistent with burst coding. These findings provide constraints for theoretical models of working memory.',\n",

Here, we use the Drosophila olfactory circuit to investigate dynamic cellular processes by which olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) target axons precisely to specific glomeruli in the ipsi- and contralateral antennal lobes. Time-lapse imaging of individual axons from 30 ORN types revealed a rich diversity in extension speed, innervation timing, and ipsilateral branch locations and identified that ipsilateral targeting occurs via stabilization of transient interstitial branches. Fast imaging using adaptive optics-corrected lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that upon approaching target, many ORN types exhibiting \"exploring branches\" consisted of parallel microtubule-based terminal branches emanating from an F-actin-rich hub. Antennal nerve ablations uncovered essential roles for bilateral axons in contralateral target selection and for ORN axons to facilitate dendritic refinement of postsynaptic partner neurons. Altogether, these observations provide cellular bases for wiring specificity establishment.',\n",

RGC feature selectivity arises from their synapses with a specific subset of amacrine (AC) and bipolar cell (BC) types, but how RGC dendrites arborize and collect input from these specific subsets remains poorly understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that RGCs employ molecular recognition systems to meet this challenge. By combining calcium imaging and type-specific histological stains, we define a family of circuits that express the recognition molecule Sidekick-1 (Sdk1), which include a novel RGC type (S1-RGC) that responds to local edges. Genetic and physiological studies revealed that Sdk1 loss selectively disrupts S1-RGC visual responses, which result from a loss of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and selective dendritic deficits on this neuron.

In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression levels of Macrobrachium rosenbergii neuropeptide F (MrNPF), and its neuroanatomical distribution in eyestalk (ES), brain (BR), subesophageal ganglion (SEG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG), during the ovarian cycle of female prawn. By qRT-PCR, the amount of MrNPF transcripts exhibited a gradual increase in the ES, BR, and combined SEG and TG from stages I and II, to reach a maximum level at stage III, and slightly declined at stage IV, respectively. The highest to lowest expression levels were detected in combined SEG and TG, BR, ES, and AG, respectively. MrNPF immunolabeling was observed in several neuronal clusters, associated fibers, and neuropils of these central nervous system (CNS) tissues. MrNPF-ir was more intense in neurons and neuropils of SEG and TG than those found in other parts of the CNS. The number of MrNPF-ir neurons and intensity of MrNPF-ir were higher in the ES, BR, SEG, and TG at the late stages than those at the early stages of the ovarian cycle, while those in AG exhibited insignificant change. Taken together, there is a correlation between changes in the neuroanatomical distribution of MrNPF and stages of the ovarian cycle, implying that MrNPF may be an important neuropeptide that integrates sensory stimuli, including photo-, chemo-, and gustatory receptions, to control feeding and reproduction, particularly ovarian development, of this female prawn, M. rosenbergii.',\n",

Over this period, we have gained a more comprehensive picture of how both spontaneous neural activity and sensory experience-induced changes in neuronal activity guide CNS circuit development. Here we review activity-dependent synaptic pruning in the mammalian CNS, which we define as the removal of a subset of synapses, while others are maintained, in response to changes in neural activity in the developing nervous system. We discuss the mounting evidence that immune and cell-death molecules are important mechanistic links by which changes in neural activity guide the pruning of specific synapses, emphasizing the role of glial cells in this process. Finally, we discuss how these developmental pruning programmes may go awry in neurodevelopmental disorders of the human CNS, focusing on autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Together, our aim is to give an overview of how the field of activity-dependent pruning research has evolved, led to exciting new questions and guided the identification of new, therapeutically relevant mechanisms that result in aberrant circuit development in neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",

As a model organism, larval zebrafish have been extensively employed to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of CNS myelination, because of their genetic tractability and suitability for non-invasive live cell imaging. However, it has not been assessed to what extent CNS myelination affects neural circuit function in zebrafish larvae, prohibiting the integration of molecular and cellular analyses of myelination with concomitant network maturation. To test whether larval zebrafish might serve as a suitable platform with which to study the effects of CNS myelination and its dysregulation on circuit function, we generated zebrafish myelin regulatory factor () mutants with CNS-specific hypomyelination and investigated how this affected their axonal conduction properties and behavior. We found that  mutant larvae exhibited increased latency to perform startle responses following defined acoustic stimuli. Furthermore, we found that hypomyelinated animals often selected an impaired response to acoustic stimuli, exhibiting a bias toward reorientation behavior instead of the stimulus-appropriate startle response. To begin to study how myelination affected the underlying circuitry, we established electrophysiological protocols to assess various conduction properties along single axons. We found that the hypomyelinated  mutants exhibited reduced action potential conduction velocity and an impaired ability to sustain high-frequency action potential firing. This study indicates that larval zebrafish can be used to bridge molecular and cellular investigation of CNS myelination with multiscale assessment of neural circuit function. Myelination of CNS axons is essential for their health and function, and it is now clear that myelination is a dynamic life-long process subject to modulation by neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear precisely how changes to myelination affects animal behavior and underlying action potential conduction along axons in intact neural circuits. In recent years, zebrafish have been employed to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of myelination, because of their relatively simple, optically transparent, experimentally tractable vertebrate nervous system. Here we find that changes to myelination alter the behavior of young zebrafish and action potential conduction along individual axons, providing a platform to integrate molecular, cellular, and circuit level analyses of myelination using this model.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by abnormal behavioral traits arising from neural circuit dysfunction. While a number of genes have been implicated in ASDs, in most cases, a clear understanding of how mutations in these genes lead to circuit dysfunction and behavioral abnormality is absent. The  () gene is one such gene, associated with ASDs, intellectual disability and a range of other neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the role of AUTS2 in neural development and circuit function is not at all known. Here, we undertook functional analysis of Auts2a, the main homolog of AUTS2 in zebrafish, in the context of the escape behavior. Escape behavior in wild-type zebrafish is critical for survival and is therefore, reliable, rapid, and has well-defined kinematic properties.  mutant zebrafish are viable, have normal gross morphology and can generate escape behavior with normal kinematics. However, the behavior is unreliable and delayed, with high trial-to-trial variability in the latency. Using calcium imaging we probed the activity of Mauthner neurons during otic vesicle (OV) stimulation and observed lower probability of activation and reduced calcium transients in the mutants. With direct activation of Mauthner by antidromic stimulation, the threshold for activation in mutants was higher than that in wild-type, even when inhibition was blocked. Taken together, these results point to reduced excitability of Mauthner neurons in  mutant larvae leading to unreliable escape responses. Our results show a novel role for Auts2a in regulating neural excitability and reliability of behavior.',\n",

Once microglia enter the brain primordium, these cells colonize the structure through migration and proliferation during brain development. Microglia account for a minor population among the total cells that constitute the developing cortex, but they can associate with many surrounding neural lineage cells by extending their filopodia and through their broad migration capacity. Of note, microglia change their distribution in a stage-dependent manner in the developing brain: microglia are homogenously distributed in the pallium in the early and late embryonic stages, whereas these cells are transiently absent from the cortical plate (CP) from embryonic day (E) 15 to E16 and colonize the ventricular zone (VZ), subventricular zone (SVZ), and intermediate zone (IZ). Previous studies have reported that microglia positioned in the VZ/SVZ/IZ play multiple roles in neural lineage cells, such as regulating neurogenesis, cell survival and neuronal circuit formation. In addition to microglial functions in the zones in which microglia are replenished, these cells indirectly contribute to the proper maturation of post-migratory neurons by exiting the CP during the mid-embryonic stage. Overall, microglial time-dependent distributional changes are necessary to provide particular functions that are required in specific regions. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of microglial colonization and multifaceted functions in the developing brain, especially focusing on the embryonic stage, and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying microglial behaviors.',\n",

We found that SCH58261 reduced the pimozide-induced TJMs. Pimozide increased the zif-268 mRNA level in the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Additionally, it increased GAD65 mRNA in the striatum and SNr, and vGluT2 mRNA levels in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). A positive correlation between zif-268, GAD65 and vGluT2 mRNAs and TJMs was found. SCH58261 reversed the pimozide-increased zif-268 mRNA in the striatum and NAc core and GAD65 mRNA in the striatum and SNr. In contrast, SCH58261 did not influence vGluT2 mRNA in STN. The present study suggests an importance of the striato-subthalamo-nigro-thalamic circuit in neuroleptic-induced TJMs. The tremorolytic effect of A receptor blockade seems to involve this circuit bypassing, however, STN.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common degenerative movement disorder, is clinically manifested with various motor and non-motor symptoms. Degeneration of midbrain  (SNc) dopaminergic neurons (DANs) is generally attributed to the motor syndrome. The underlying neuronal mechanisms of non-motor syndrome are largely unexplored. Besides SNc, midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) DANs also produce and release dopamine and modulate movement, reward, motivation, and memory. Degeneration of VTA DANs also occurs in postmortem brains of PD patients, implying an involvement of VTA DANs in PD-associated non-motor symptoms. However, it remains to be established that there is a distinct segregation of different SNc and VTA DAN subtypes in regulating different motor and non-motor functions, and that different DAN subpopulations are differentially affected by normal ageing or PD. Traditionally, the distinction among different DAN subtypes was mainly based on the location of cell bodies and axon terminals. With the recent advance of single cell RNA sequencing technology, DANs can be readily classified based on unique gene expression profiles. A combination of specific anatomic and molecular markers shows great promise to facilitate the identification of DAN subpopulations corresponding to different behavior modules under normal and disease conditions. In this review, we first summarize the recent progress in characterizing genetically, anatomically, and functionally diverse midbrain DAN subtypes. Then, we provide perspectives on how the preclinical research on the connectivity and functionality of DAN subpopulations improves our current understanding of cell-type and circuit specific mechanisms of the disease, which could be critically informative for designing new mechanistic treatments.\",\n",

We conducted post-mortem studies of the brains of 6 individuals aged 56-87 years.

Statistical analysis was subsequently performed. We observed an age-related reduction in the cell population of the external pyramidal layer of the entorhinal cortex, and in the number of neurons in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus.

       "  'abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD) commences several years before the onset of motor features. Pathophysiological understanding of the pre-clinical or early prodromal stages of PD are essential for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Two categories of patients are ideal to study the early disease stages. Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) represents a well-known prodromal stage of PD in which pathology is presumed to have reached the lower brainstem. The majority of patients with iRBD will develop manifest PD within years to decades. Another category encompasses non-manifest mutation carriers, i.e. subjects without symptoms, but with a known mutation or genetic variant which gives an increased risk of developing PD. The speed of progression from preclinical or prodromal to full clinical stages varies among patients and cannot be reliably predicted on the individual level. Clinical trials will require inclusion of patients with a predictable conversion within a limited time window. Biomarkers are necessary that can confirm pre-motor PD status and can provide information regarding lead time and speed of progression. Neuroimaging changes occur early in the disease process and may provide such a biomarker. Studies have focused on radiotracer imaging of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, which can be assessed with dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Loss of DAT binding represents an effect of irreversible structural damage to the nigrostriatal system. This marker can be used to monitor disease progression and identify individuals at specific risk for phenoconversion. However, it is known that changes in neuronal activity precede structural changes. Functional neuro-imaging techniques, such as F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography (F-FDG PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can be used to model the effects of disease on brain networks when combined with advanced analytical methods. Because these changes occur early in the disease process, functional imaging studies are of particular interest in prodromal PD diagnosis. In addition, fMRI and F-FDG PET may be able to predict a specific future phenotype in prodromal cohorts, which is not possible with DAT SPECT. The goal of the current review is to discuss the network-level brain changes in pre-motor PD.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dynamic causal models (DCMs) of electrophysiological data allow, in principle, for inference on hidden, bulk synaptic function in neural circuits. The directed influences between the neuronal elements of modeled circuits are subject to delays due to the finite transmission speed of axonal connections. Ordinary differential equations are therefore not adequate to capture the ensuing circuit dynamics, and delay differential equations (DDEs) are required instead. Previous work has illustrated that the integration of DDEs in DCMs benefits from sophisticated integration schemes in order to ensure rigorous parameter estimation and correct model identification. However, integration schemes that have been proposed for DCMs either emphasize speed (at the possible expense of accuracy) or robustness (but with computational costs that are problematic in practice). In this technical note, we propose an alternative integration scheme that overcomes these shortcomings and offers high computational efficiency while correctly preserving the nature of delayed effects. This integration scheme is available as open-source code in the Translational Algorithms for Psychiatry-Advancing Science (TAPAS) toolbox and can be easily integrated into existing software (SPM) for the analysis of DCMs for electrophysiological data. While this paper focuses on its application to the convolution-based formalism of DCMs, the new integration scheme can be equally applied to more advanced formulations of DCMs (e.g. conductance based models). Our method provides a new option for electrophysiological DCMs that offers the speed required for scientific projects, but also the accuracy required for rigorous translational applications, e.g. in computational psychiatry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Survival of animals is dependent on the correct selection of an appropriate behavioral response to competing external stimuli. Theoretical models have been proposed and underlying mechanisms are emerging to explain how one circuit is selected among competing neural circuits. The evolutionarily conserved forebrain to midbrain habenulo-interpeduncular nucleus (Hb-IPN) pathway consists of cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons, which mediate different aversive behaviors. Simultaneous calcium imaging of neuronal cell bodies and of the population dynamics of their axon terminals reveals that signals in the cell bodies are not reflective of terminal activity. We find that axon terminals of cholinergic and non-cholinergic habenular neurons exhibit stereotypic patterns of spontaneous activity that are negatively correlated and localize to discrete subregions of the target IPN. Patch-clamp recordings show that calcium bursts in cholinergic terminals at the ventral IPN trigger excitatory currents in IPN neurons, which precede inhibition of non-cholinergic terminals at the adjacent dorsal IPN. Inhibition is mediated through presynaptic GABA receptors activated in non-cholinergic habenular neurons upon GABA release from the target IPN. Together, the results reveal a hardwired mode of competition at the terminals of two excitatory neuronal populations, providing a physiological framework to explore the relationship between different aversive responses.',\n",

However, the commonly used synaptic devices (e.g., memristors and transistors) require an extra modulate terminal to mimic heterosynaptic plasticity, and their capability of synaptic plasticity simulation is limited by the low weight adjustability. In this study, a WSe -based memtransistor for mimicking both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic plasticity is fabricated. By applying spikes on either the drain or gate terminal, the memtransistor can mimic common homosynaptic plasticity, including spiking rate dependent plasticity, paired pulse facilitation/depression, synaptic potentiation/depression, and filtering. Benefitting from the multi-terminal input and high adjustability, the resistance state number and linearity of the memtransistor can be improved by optimizing the conditions of the two inputs. Moreover, the device can successfully mimic heterosynaptic plasticity without introducing an extra terminal and can simultaneously offer versatile reconfigurability of excitatory and inhibitory plasticity. These highly adjustable and reconfigurable characteristics offer memtransistors more freedom of choice for tuning synaptic weight, optimizing circuit design, and building artificial neuromorphic computing systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Assessment of neural activity in the specific brain area is critical for understanding the circuit mechanisms underlying altered brain function and behaviors. A number of immediate early genes (IEGs) that are rapidly transcribed in neuronal cells in response to synaptic activity have been used as markers for neuronal activity. However, protein detection of IEGs requires translation, and the amount of newly synthesized gene product is usually insufficient to detect using western blotting, limiting their utility in western blot analysis of brain tissues for comparison of basal activity between control and genetically modified animals. Here, we show that the phosphorylation status of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) rapidly changes in response to synaptic and neural activities. Intraperitoneal injections of the GABA A receptor (GABAR) antagonist picrotoxin and the glycine receptor antagonist brucine rapidly dephosphorylated eEF2. Conversely, potentiation of GABARs or inhibition of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) induced rapid phosphorylation of eEF2 in both the hippocampus and forebrain of mice. Chemogenetic suppression of hippocampal principal neuron activity promoted eEF2 phosphorylation. Novel context exploration and acute restraint stress rapidly modified the phosphorylation status of hippocampal eEF2. Furthermore, the hippocampal eEF2 phosphorylation levels under basal conditions were reduced in mice exhibiting epilepsy and abnormally enhanced excitability in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Collectively, the results indicated that eEF2 phosphorylation status is sensitive to neural activity and the ratio of phosphorylated eEF2 to total eEF2 could be a molecular signature for estimating neural activity in a specific brain area.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The dorsal visual stream, the cortical circuit that in the primate brain is mainly dedicated to the visual control of actions, is split into two routes, a lateral and a medial one, both involved in coding different aspects of sensorimotor control of actions. The lateral route, named \"lateral grasping network\", is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation. The medial route, named \"reach-to-grasp network\", is involved in the control of the full deployment of prehension act, from the direction of arm movement to the shaping of the hand according to the object to be grasped. In macaque monkeys, the reach-to-grasp network (the target of this review) includes areas of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that hosts visual and somatosensory neurons well suited to control goal-directed limb movements toward stationary as well as moving objects. After a brief summary of the neuronal functional properties of these areas, we will analyze their cortical and thalamic inputs thanks to retrograde neuronal tracers separately injected into the SPL areas V6, V6A, PEc, and PE. These areas receive visual and somatosensory information distributed in a caudorostral, visuosomatic trend, and some of them are directly connected with the dorsal premotor cortex. This review is particularly focused on the origin and type of visual information reaching the SPL, and on the functional role this information can play in guiding limb interaction with objects in structured and dynamic environments.',\n",

Here, we report that gap junction proteins, Innexins play crucial roles in determining the intrinsic period of activity-rest rhythms in flies.

Here, we show that an expression of RGS14414 in rat perirhinal cortex (PRh) produced long-lasting object recognition memory (ORM) enhancement and that this effect was mediated through the upregulation of 14-3-3ζ, which caused a boost in BDNF protein levels and increase in pyramidal neuron dendritic arborization and dendritic spine number. A knockdown of the 14-3-3ζ gene in rat or the deletion of the BDNF gene in mice caused complete loss in ORM enhancement and increase in BDNF protein levels and neuronal plasticity, indicating that 14-3-3ζ-BDNF pathway-mediated structural plasticity is an essential step in RGS14414-induced memory enhancement. We further observed that RGS14414 treatment was able to prevent deficits in recognition, spatial, and temporal memory, which are types of memory that are particularly affected in patients with memory dysfunctions, in rodent models of aging and Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that 14-3-3ζ-BDNF pathway might play an important role in the maintenance of the synaptic structures in PRh that support memory functions and that RGS14414-mediated activation of this pathway could serve as a remedy to treat memory deficits.\",\n",

Surprisingly, experiments show that most of this flux in connectivity persists in the absence of learning or known plasticity signals. How can neural circuits retain learned information despite a large proportion of ongoing and potentially disruptive synaptic changes? We address this question from first principles by analysing how much compensatory plasticity would be required to optimally counteract ongoing fluctuations, regardless of whether fluctuations are random or systematic. Remarkably, we find that the answer is largely independent of plasticity mechanisms and circuit architectures: compensatory plasticity should be at most equal in magnitude to fluctuations, and often less, in direct agreement with previously unexplained experimental observations. Moreover, our analysis shows that a high proportion of learning-independent synaptic change is consistent with plasticity mechanisms that accurately compute error gradients.',\n",

The consequences of ELS are complex because they depend on the form and severity of early stress, duration, and age of exposure as well as co-occurrence with other forms of physical or psychological trauma. The long term effects of ELS on the corticolimbic circuit underlying emotional and social behavior are particularly salient because ELS occurs during critical developmental periods in the establishment of this circuit, its local balance of inhibition:excitation and its connections with other neuronal pathways. Using examples drawn from the human and rodent literature, we review some of the consequences of ELS on the development of the corticolimbic circuit and how it might impact fear regulation in a sex- and hemispheric-dependent manner in both humans and rodents. We explore the effects of ELS on local inhibitory neurons and the formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) that terminate critical periods of plasticity and promote the formation of stable local networks. Overall, the bulk of ELS studies report transient and/or long lasting alterations in both glutamatergic circuits and local inhibitory interneurons (INs) and their associated PNNs. Since the activity of INs plays a key role in the maturation of cortical regions and the formation of local field potentials, alterations in these INs triggered by ELS might critically participate in the development of psychiatric disorders in adulthood, including impaired fear extinction and anxiety behavior.',\n",

Our investigation on disinhibitory mechanisms in the classical model of ocular dominance plasticity uncovered an unexpected form of experience-dependent circuit plasticity. In the layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex, monocular deprivation triggers a complete, \"all-or-none,\" elimination of connections from pyramidal cells onto nearby parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Pyr→PV). This binary form of circuit plasticity is unique, as it is transient, local, and discrete. It lasts only 1 d, and it does not manifest as widespread changes in synaptic strength; rather, only about half of local connections are lost, and the remaining ones are not affected in strength. Mechanistically, the deprivation-induced loss of Pyr→PV is contingent on a reduction of the protein neuropentraxin2. Functionally, the loss of Pyr→PV is absolutely necessary for ocular dominance plasticity, a canonical model of deprivation-induced model of cortical remodeling. We surmise, therefore, that this all-or-none loss of local Pyr→PV circuitry gates experience-dependent cortical plasticity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A fundamental question in neuroscience is whether neuronal circuits with variable circuit parameters that produce similar outputs respond comparably to equivalent perturbations. Work on the pyloric rhythm of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) showed that highly variable sets of intrinsic and synaptic conductances can generate similar circuit activity patterns. Importantly, in response to physiologically relevant perturbations, these disparate circuit solutions can respond robustly and reliably, but when exposed to extreme perturbations the underlying circuit parameter differences produce diverse patterns of disrupted activity. In this example, the pyloric circuit is unchanged; only the conductance values vary. In contrast, the gastric mill rhythm in the STG can be generated by distinct circuits when activated by different modulatory neurons and/or neuropeptides. Generally, these distinct circuits produce different gastric mill rhythms. However, the rhythms driven by stimulating modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) and bath-applying CabPK (Cancer borealis pyrokinin) peptide generate comparable output patterns, despite having distinct circuits that use separate cellular and synaptic mechanisms. Here, we use these two gastric mill circuits to determine whether such circuits respond comparably when challenged with persisting (hormonal: CCAP) or acute (sensory: GPR neuron) metabotropic influences. Surprisingly, the hormone-mediated action separates these two rhythms despite activating the same ionic current in the same circuit neuron during both rhythms, whereas the sensory neuron evokes comparable responses despite acting via different synapses during each rhythm. These results highlight the need for\\xa0caution when inferring the circuit response to a perturbation when that circuit is not well defined physiologically.',\n",

Here we show that plasticity in sensory neurons mediates a behavioral switch in C. elegans between attraction to NaCl in naïve animals and avoidance of NaCl in preconditioned animals, called gustatory plasticity. Ca imaging in ASE and ASH NaCl sensing neurons reveals multiple cell-autonomous and distributed circuit adaptation mechanisms. A computational model quantitatively accounts for observed behaviors and reveals roles for sensory neurons in the control and modulation of motor behaviors, decision making and navigational strategy. Sensory adaptation dynamically alters the encoding of the environment. Rather than encoding the stimulus directly, therefore, we propose that these C. elegans sensors dynamically encode a context-dependent value of the stimulus. Our results demonstrate how adaptive sensory computation can directly control an animal's behavioral state.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We investigated the protective effect and mechanisms of apigenin against cognitive impairments in a scopolamine-injected mouse model. Our results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine leads to learning and memory dysfunction, whereas the administration of apigenin (synthetic compound, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) improved cognitive ability, which was confirmed by behavioral tests such as the T-maze test, novel objective recognition test, and Morris water maze test in mice. In addition, scopolamine-induced lipid peroxidation in the brain was attenuated by administration of apigenin. To further evaluate the protective mechanisms of apigenin on cognitive and memory function, Western blot analysis was carried out. Administration of apigenin decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio and suppressed caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, apigenin down-regulated the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, along with presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 protein levels. Apigenin-administered mice showed lower protein levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end-products, whereas insulin-degrading enzyme, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression were promoted by treatment with apigenin. Therefore, this study demonstrated that apigenin is an active substance that can improve cognitive and memory functions by regulating apoptosis, amyloidogenesis, and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuron tracing, as the essential step for neural circuit building and brain information flow analyzing, plays an important role in the understanding of brain organization and function. Though lots of methods have been proposed, automatic and accurate neuron tracing from optical images remains challenging. Current methods often had trouble in tracing the complex tree-like distorted structures and broken parts of neurite from a noisy background. To address these issues, we propose a method for accurate neuron tracing using content-aware adaptive voxel scooping on a convolutional neural network (CNN) predicted probability map. First, a 3D residual CNN was applied as preprocessing to predict the object probability and suppress high noise. Then, instead of tracing on the binary image produced by maximum classification, an adaptive voxel scooping method was presented for successive neurite tracing on the probability map, based on the internal content properties (distance, connectivity, and probability continuity along direction) of the neurite. Last, the neuron tree graph was built using the length first criterion. The proposed method was evaluated on the public BigNeuron datasets and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) datasets and outperformed current state-of-art methods on images with neurites that had broken parts and complex structures. The high accuracy tracing proved the potential of the proposed method for neuron tracing on large-scale.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Intrinsic neuronal variability significantly limits information encoding in the primary visual cortex (V1). However, under certain conditions, neurons can respond reliably with highly precise responses to the same visual stimuli from trial to trial. This suggests that there exists intrinsic neural circuit mechanisms that dynamically modulate the intertrial variability of visual cortical neurons. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of different inhibitory interneurons (INs) in reliable coding in mouse V1. To study the interactions between somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), we used a dual-color calcium imaging technique that allowed us to simultaneously monitor these two neural ensembles while awake mice, of both sexes, passively viewed natural movies. SST neurons were more active during epochs of reliable pyramidal neuron firing, whereas PV neurons were more active during epochs of unreliable firing. SST neuron activity lagged that of PV neurons, consistent with a feedback inhibitory SST→PV circuit. To dissect the role of this circuit in pyramidal neuron activity, we used temporally limited optogenetic activation and inactivation of SST and PV interneurons during periods of reliable and unreliable pyramidal cell firing. Transient firing of SST neurons increased pyramidal neuron reliability by actively suppressing PV neurons, a proposal that was supported by a rate-based model of V1 neurons. These results identify a cooperative functional role for the SST→PV circuit in modulating the reliability of pyramidal neuron activity. Cortical neurons often respond to identical sensory stimuli with large variability. However, under certain conditions, the same neurons can also respond highly reliably. The circuit mechanisms that contribute to this modulation remain unknown. Here, we used novel dual-wavelength calcium imaging and temporally selective optical perturbation to identify an inhibitory neural circuit in visual cortex that can modulate the reliability of pyramidal neurons to naturalistic visual stimuli. Our results, supported by computational models, suggest that somatostatin interneurons increase pyramidal neuron reliability by suppressing parvalbumin interneurons via the inhibitory SST→PV circuit. These findings reveal a novel role of the SST→PV circuit in modulating the fidelity of neural coding critical for visual perception.',\n",

Considering our previous studies, showing the specificity of rat postrhinal cortex comprising specific neuronal circuit for encoding both the learning and recall of shape discrimination through a fast neurotransmitter release from the transduced neurons, here we have demonstrated that postsynaptic neurons in two distinct areas, perirhinal cortex and the ventral temporal association areas are required for the specific visual shape discriminations learning. The constitutively active PKC was delivered into neuronal cells in postrhinal cortex, and the animals were allowed to learn the new shape discriminations, and then the silencing siRNA was delivered into postsynaptic neurons in either perirhinal cortex or ventral temporal association areas, using a novel technology for gene transfer into connected neurons. We observed that expression of the siRNA caused the deficits in visual performance, via blocking the activity in the neurons, as displayed by activity-dependent gene imaging, and also subsequently obstructed the activation of specific signaling pathways required for further learning, and dendritic protein synthesis and CREB. Thus, ratifying the conclusion that the two parallel circuits are both required for the visual shape discrimination learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Glomeruli are neuropil-rich regions of the main or accessory olfactory bulbs (AOB) where the axons of olfactory or vomeronasal neurons and dendrites of mitral/tufted cells form synaptic connections. In the main olfactory system, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same receptor innervate 1 or 2 glomeruli. However, in the accessory olfactory system, vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) expressing the same receptor can innervate up to 30 different glomeruli in the AOB. Genetic mutation disrupting genes with a role in defining the identity/diversity of olfactory and vomeronasal neurons can alter the number and size of glomeruli. Interestingly, 2 cell surface molecules, Kirrel2 and Kirrel3, have been indicated as playing a critical role in the organization of axons into glomeruli in the AOB. Being able to quantify differences in glomeruli features, such as number, size, or immunoreactivity for specific markers, is an important experimental approach to validate the role of specific genes in controlling neuronal connectivity and circuit formation in either control or mutant animals. Since the manual recognition and quantification of glomeruli on digital images is a challenging and time-consuming task, we generated a program in Python able to identify glomeruli in digital images and quantify their properties, such as size, number, and pixel intensity. Validation of our program indicates that our script is a fast and suitable tool for high-throughput quantification of glomerular features of mouse lines with different genetic makeup.',\n",

Here, we examined the impact of deleting TrkB, a BDNF receptor, in parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons on the balance of excitation and inhibition (E-I) in cortical circuits. In the mouse olfactory cortex, TrkB deletion impairs multiple aspects of PV neuronal function including synaptic excitation, intrinsic excitability, and the innervation pattern of principal neurons. Impaired PV cell function resulted in aberrant spiking patterns in principal neurons in response to stimulation of sensory inputs. Surprisingly, dampened PV neuronal function leads to a paradoxical decrease in overall excitability in cortical circuits.

Compared to LIP, PFC showed greater nonlinear integration of currently visible and remembered stimuli, which correlated with the monkeys' M/NM decisions. Furthermore, multi-module recurrent networks trained on the same task exhibited key features of PFC and LIP encoding, including nonlinear integration in the PFC-like module, which was causally involved in the networks' decisions.

The detection of urine stimuli induces synaptic plasticity in the vomeronasal pathway and the dorsal hippocampus, even in animals with experimentally induced anosmia. In the dorsal hippocampus, this plasticity is associated with the overexpression of pAKT and pGSK3β.

Pyramidal neurons in layer-5 of the PFC can be classified as two subtypes depending on the inducibility of prominent hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (h-current). However, the differences in the neurophysiological alterations between these two subtypes in rodent models of AD remain poorly understood. To investigate the neurophysiological alterations between two subtypes of pyramidal neurons in hAPP-J20 mice, a transgenic model for early onset AD. The synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons were investigated using whole-cell patch recordings. The morphological complexity of pyramidal neurons was detected by biocytin labelling and subsequent Sholl analysis. We found reduced synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability of the prominent h-current (PH) cells but not the non-PH cells in hAPP-J20 mice. Furthermore, the function of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels which mediated h-current was disrupted in the PH cells of hAPP-J20 mice. Sholl analysis revealed that PH cells had less dendritic intersections in hAPP-J20 mice comparing to control mice, implying that a lower morphological complexity might contribute to the reduced neuronal activity. These results suggest that the PH cells in the medial PFC may be more vulnerable to degeneration in hAPP-J20 mice and play a sustainable role in frontal dysfunction in AD. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Endocannabinoids modulate mesolimbic (MSL) dopamine (DA) neurons firing at the ventral tegmental area (VTA). These neurons are activated by copulation, increasing DA release in nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Copulation to satiety in male rats implies repeated ejaculation within a short period (around 2.5 h), during which NAcc dopamine concentrations remain elevated, suggesting continuous neuronal activation. During the 72 h that follow copulation to satiety, males exhibit long-lasting changes suggestive of brain plasticity processes. Enhanced DA neuron activity triggers the synthesis and release of endocannabinoids (eCBs) in the VTA, which participate in several long-term synaptic plasticity processes. Blockade of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) during copulation to satiety interferes with the appearance of the plastic changes. Glutamatergic inputs to the VTA express CB1Rs and contribute to DA neuron burst firing and synaptic plasticity. We hypothesized that eCBs, released during copulation to satiety, would activate VTA CB1Rs and modulate synaptic plasticity processes involving glutamatergic transmission. To test this hypothesis, we determined changes in VTA CB1R density, phosphorylation, and internalization in rats that copulated to satiety 24 h earlier as compared both to animals that ejaculated only once and to sexually experienced unmated males. Changes in glutamate AMPAR and NMDAR densities and subunit composition and in ERK1/2 activation were determined in the VTA of males that copulated to satiety in the presence or absence of AM251, a CB1R antagonist. The CB1R density decreased and the proportion of phosphorylated CB1Rs increased in the animals that copulated compared to control rats. The CB1R internalization was detected only in sexually satiated males. A decrease in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptor (AMPAR) density, blocked by AM251 pretreatment, and an increase in the proportion of GluA2-AMPARs occurred in sexually satiated rats. GluN2A- N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) expression decreased, and GluN2B-NMDARs increased in these animals, both of which were prevented by AM251 pre-treatment. An increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 emerged in males copulating to satiety in the presence of AM251. Results demonstrate that during copulation to satiety, eCBs activate CB1Rs in the VTA, producing changes in glutamate receptors compatible with a reduced neuronal activation. These changes could play a role in the induction of the long-lasting physiological changes that characterize sexually satiated rats.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability in which delays and impairments in brain development and function lead to neurological and cognitive phenotypes. Traditionally, a neurocentric approach, focusing on neurons and their connectivity, has been applied to understanding the mechanisms involved in DS brain pathophysiology with an emphasis on how triplication of chromosome 21 leads to alterations in neuronal survival and homeostasis, synaptogenesis, brain circuit development, and neurodegeneration. However, recent studies have drawn attention to the role of non-neuronal cells, especially astrocytes, in DS. Astrocytes comprise a large proportion of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are critical for brain development, homeostasis, and function. As triplication of chromosome 21 occurs in all cells in DS (with the exception of mosaic DS), a deeper understanding of the impact of trisomy 21 on astrocytes in DS pathophysiology is warranted and will likely be necessary for determining how specific brain alterations and neurological phenotypes emerge and progress in DS. Here, we review the current understanding of the role of astrocytes in DS, and discuss how specific perturbations in this cell type can impact the brain across the lifespan from early brain development to adult stages. Finally, we highlight how targeting, modifying, and/or correcting specific molecular pathways and properties of astrocytes in DS may provide an effective therapeutic direction given the important role of astrocytes in regulating brain development and function.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The circuitry of addiction comprises several neural networks including the midbrain - an expansive region critically involved in the control of motivated behaviors. Midbrain nuclei like the Edinger-Westphal (EW) and dorsal raphe (DR) contain unique populations of neurons that synthesize many understudied neuroactive molecules and are encircled by the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Despite the proximity of these special neuron classes to the ventral midbrain complex and surrounding PAG, functions of the EW and DR remain substantially underinvestigated by comparison. Spanning approximately -3.0 to -5.2\\xa0mm posterior from bregma in the mouse, these various cell groups form a continuum of neurons that we refer to collectively as the subaqueductal paramedian zone. Defining how these pathways modulate affective behavioral states presents a difficult, yet conquerable challenge for today's technological advances in neuroscience. In this review, we cover the known contributions of different neuronal subtypes of the subaqueductal paramedian zone. We catalogue these cell types based on their spatial, molecular, connectivity, and functional properties and integrate this information with the existing data on the EW and DR in addiction. We next discuss evidence that links the EW and DR anatomically and functionally, highlighting the potential contributions of an EW-DR circuit to addiction-related behaviors. Overall, we aim to derive an integrated framework that emphasizes the contributions of EW and DR nuclei to addictive states and describes how these cell groups function in individuals suffering from substance use disorders.

In the central nervous system, mitochondria sustain synaptic transmission and plasticity via multiple mechanisms which include their redistribution and/or expansion to higher energy demanding sites, sustaining activity changes and promoting morphological circuit adaptations. To be able to evaluate changes in mitochondrial number and protein phenotype, we propose a novel methodological approach where the simultaneous analysis of both mitochondrial DNA and protein content is performed on each individual microsample, avoiding non-homogeneous loss of material. We validated this method on neuronal-like cells and tissue samples and obtained estimates for the mitochondrial/genomic DNA ratio as well as for the abundance of protein counterparts. When the mitochondrial content per cell was evaluated in different brain areas, our results matched the known regional variation in aerobic-anaerobic metabolism. When long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced on hippocampal neurons, we detected increases in the abundance of mitochondria that correlated with the degree of synaptic enhancement. Our approach can be effectively used to study the mitochondrial content andits changes in different brain cells and tissues. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neural activity sculpts circuit wiring in many animals. In vertebrates, patterned spontaneous network activity (PaSNA) generates sensory maps and establishes local circuits. However, it remains unclear how PaSNA might shape neuronal circuits and behavior in invertebrates. Previous work in the developing Drosophila embryo discovered intrinsic muscle activity that did not require synaptic transmission, and hence was myogenic, preceding PaSNA. These studies, however, monitored muscle movement, not neural activity, and were therefore unable to observe how myogenic activity might relate to subsequent neural network engagement. Here we use calcium imaging to directly record neural activity and characterize the emergence of PaSNA. We demonstrate that the spatiotemporal properties of PaSNA are highly stereotyped across embryos, arguing for genetic programming. Neural activity begins well before it becomes patterned, emerging during the myogenic stage. Remarkably, inhibition of mechanosensory input, as well as inhibition of muscle contractions, results in premature and excessive PaSNA, demonstrating that muscle movement serves as a brake on this process. Finally, transient mechanosensory inhibition during PaSNA, followed by quantitative modeling of larval behavior, shows that mechanosensory modulation during development is required for proper larval foraging. This work provides a foundation for using the Drosophila embryo to study the role of PaSNA in circuit formation, provides mechanistic insight into how PaSNA is entrained by motor activity, and demonstrates that spontaneous network activity is essential for locomotor behavior. These studies argue that sensory feedback during the earliest stages of circuit formation can sculpt locomotor behaviors through innate motor learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Understanding the molecular events that regulate cell pluripotency versus acquisition of differentiated somatic cell fate is fundamentally important. Studies in  demonstrate that knockout of the germline-specific translation repressor  causes germ cells within tumorous gonads to form germline-derived teratoma. Previously we demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress enhances this phenotype to suppress germline tumor progression(Levi-Ferber et al., 2015). Here, we identify a neuronal circuit that non-autonomously suppresses germline differentiation and show that it communicates with the gonad via the neurotransmitter serotonin to limit somatic differentiation of the tumorous germline. ER stress controls this circuit through regulated inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1)-dependent mRNA decay of transcripts encoding the neuropeptide FLP-6. Depletion of FLP-6 disrupts the circuit's integrity and hence its ability to prevent somatic-fate acquisition by germline tumor cells. Our findings reveal mechanistically how ER stress enhances ectopic germline differentiation and demonstrate that regulated Ire1-dependent decay can affect animal physiology by controlling a specific neuronal circuit.\",\n",

Less is known about astrocytes contributions towards circuits and behavior in the adult brain. Astrocytes play important roles in synaptic development and modulation, however their contributions towards neuronal sensory function and maintenance of neuronal circuit architecture remain unclear. Here, we show that loss of the transcription factor Sox9 results in both anatomical and functional changes in adult mouse olfactory bulb (OB) astrocytes, affecting sensory processing. Indeed, astrocyte-specific deletion of Sox9 in the OB results in decreased odor detection thresholds and discrimination and it is associated with aberrant neuronal sensory response maps. At functional level, loss of astrocytic Sox9 impairs the electrophysiological properties of mitral and tufted neurons. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals widespread changes in the gene expression profiles of OB astrocytes. In particular, we observe reduced GLT-1 expression and consequential alterations in glutamate transport. Our findings reveal that astrocytes are required for physiological sensory processing and we identify astrocytic Sox9 as an essential transcriptional regulator of mature astrocyte function in the mouse OB.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Histamine is a biological amine that functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain to regulate arousal, appetite, and cognitive functions. Many pharmacological studies using histamine receptor agonists and antagonists have found that histamine promotes memory consolidation and retrieval. More recently, we have revealed that the activation of the brain histaminergic system by HR antagonists/inverse agonists restores retrieval of forgotten long-term memory in mice and humans. The recovery of memory retrieval may involve histamine-induced excitatory effects. Histamine may increase neuronal excitability throughout the neural circuit, including both neurons that are and are not recruited into the memory trace, similar to noise added to the neural circuits for memory retrieval. Stochastic resonance can explain how adding noise to the circuit enhances memory retrieval. Memory is processed not only by consolidation and retrieval, but also by various processes such as maintenance, reconsolidation, extinction, and reinstatement. Further studies that separately analyze the memory processes are needed to elucidate the whole picture of the effects of histamine on learning and memory. Regarding the human histaminergic system, alterations in histamine signaling have been reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders, and these changes have been suggested to be involved in cognitive dysfunction in patients with the neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the drugs that modulate histamine signaling, including HR antagonists/inverse agonists, may be effective in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

If 2-heptanone acts as a danger signal, then long-lasting actions would be expected. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the forced inhalation of 2-heptanone modifies the response capacity of the BLA-mPFC circuit in the long term (48\\xa0h). Single-unit extracellular recordings were obtained from the PL and IL during electrical stimulation of the BLA (square-wave pulses; 1\\xa0ms, 20 µA, 0.3\\xa0Hz, 110 stimuli over a total duration of 360\\xa0s) in three groups of Wistar rats: control group (no sensory stimulation), unpredictable auditory stimulation group, and 2-heptanone stimulation group. A brief-latency (1\\xa0ms), short-duration (5\\xa0ms) paucisynaptic response followed BLA stimulation and was unaffected by any sensorial stimulation. The paucisynaptic response was followed by a mostly inhibitory and long-lasting (>750\\xa0ms) afterdischarge in the control and auditory stimulation groups. In the 2-heptanone group, the inhibitory afterdischarge shifted to an excitatory afterdischarge after ∼250\\xa0ms in the PL and after ∼500\\xa0ms in the IL. Importantly, the rats that were included in this study were born in local housing facilities. Thus, these animals were never in contact with predators and instead in contact with only conspecifics. These results indicate that the forced inhalation of 2-heptanone is able to modify BLA-mPFC responsivity in the long term. 2-Heptanone decreases inhibitory control of the amygdala over mPFC activity. Disinhibition of the mPFC may lead to the adaptive expression of defensive behaviors, even in animals that are not in the presence of predators.',\n",

Immune signaling molecules serve as a common language between the immune system and CNS, allowing them to work together to modulate brain function both in health and disease. As the resident CNS macrophage, microglia comprise the majority of immune cells in the brain. Much like their peripheral counterparts, microglia survey their environment for pathology, clean up debris, and propagate inflammatory responses when necessary. Beyond this, recent studies have highlighted that microglia perform a number of complex tasks during neural development, from directing neuronal and axonal positioning to pruning synapses, receptors, and even whole cells. In this chapter, we discuss this literature within the framework that immune activation during discrete windows of neural development can profoundly impact brain function long-term, and thus the risk of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this chapter, we review three sensitive developmental periods - embryonic wiring, early postnatal synaptic pruning, and adolescent circuit refinement - in order to highlight the diversity of functions that microglia perform in building a brain. In reviewing this literature, it becomes obvious that timing matters, perhaps more so than the nature of the immune activation itself; largely conserved patterns of microglial response to diverse insults result in different functional impacts depending on the stage of brain maturation at the time of the challenge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) is one of the critical factors in the occurrence and development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Apoptosis of nerve cells and changes in synaptic activity after CCI are the key factors to induce VCI. Synaptic stimulation up-regulates intraneuronal Ca level through N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) via induction of the activity-regulated inhibitor of death (AID) expression to produce active-dependent neuroprotection. Moreover, the regulation of synaptic plasticity could improve cognition and learning ability. Activin A (ActA), an exocrine protein of AID, can promote NMDAR phosphorylation and participate in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. We previously found that exogenous ActA can improve the cognitive function of rats with chronic cerebral ischemia and enhance the oxygenated glucose deprivation of intracellular Ca level. In addition to NMDAR, the Wnt pathway is critical in the positive regulation of LTP through activation or inhibition. It plays an essential role in synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The enriched environment can increase ActA expression during CCI injury. We speculated that the NMDAR-Ca-ActA signal pathway has a loop-acting mode, and the environmental enrichment could improve chronic cerebral ischemia cognitive impairment via NMDAR-Ca-ActA, Wnt/β-catenin pathway is involved in this process. For the hypothesis verification, this study intends to establish chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rat model, explore the improvement effect of enriched environment on VCI, detect the changes in plasticity of synaptic morphology and investigate the regulatory mechanism NMDAR-Ca-ActA-Wnt/β-catenin signaling loop, providing a therapeutic method for the treatment of CCH.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Our understanding of the role of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) has evolved as technology has advanced, in part due to cell-specific studies and complex behavioral assays. This is reflected in the heterogeneous neuronal populations within the PBN to the extended amygdala (EA) circuits which encompass the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central amygdala (CeA) circuitry, as they differentially modulate aspects of behavior in response to diverse threat-like contexts necessary for survival. Here we review how the PBN→CeA and PBN→BNST pathways differentially modulate fear-like behavior, innate and conditioned, through unique changes in neurotransmission in response to stress-inducing contexts. Furthermore, we hypothesize how in specific instances the PBN→CeA and PBN→BNST circuits are redundant and in part intertwined with their respective reciprocal projections. By deconstructing the interoceptive and exteroceptive components of affect- and stress related behavioral paradigms, evidence suggests that the PBN→CeA circuit modulates innate response to physical stimuli and fear conditioning. Conversely, the PBN→BNST circuit modulates distress-like stress in unpredictable contexts. Thereby, the PBN provides a pathway for alarming interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli to be processed and relayed to the EA to induce stress-relevant affect. Additionally, we provide a framework for future studies to detail the cell-type specific intricacies of PBN→EA circuits in mediating behavioral responses to threats, and the relevance of the PBN in drug-use as it relates to threat and negative reinforcement.

Their primary mechanism of action occurs via neuroprotective effects by trophic factors, anti-inflammatory effects, and immunomodulation.

We hypothesized that cells induced to neural lineages would fit the niche, replace the lesion, and be more effective in improving symptoms compared with stem cells themselves. We investigated the characteristics of induced neural cells from human dental pulp tissue and compared the transplantation effects between these induced neural cells and uninduced dental pulp stem cells. Induced neural cells or dental pulp stem cells were intracerebrally transplanted 5\\xa0days after cerebral infarction induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in immunodeficient mice. Effects on functional recovery were also assessed through behavior testing. We used immunohistochemistry and neuron tracing to analyze the differentiation, axonal extension, and connectivity of transplanted cells to the host's neural circuit. Transplantation of induced neural cells from human dental pulp ameliorated functional recovery after cerebral infarction compared with dental pulp stem cells. The induced neural cells comprised both neurons and glia and expressed functional voltage, and they were more related to neurogenesis in terms of transcriptomics.

       "  'abstract': \"Dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) are controlled by multiple factors, many involved in neurological disease. Parkinson's disease motor symptoms are caused by the demise of nigral DA neurons, leading to loss of striatal dopamine (DA). Here, we measured DA concentration in the dorsal striatum of 32 members of Collaborative Cross (CC) family and their eight founder strains. Striatal DA varied greatly in founders, and differences were highly heritable in the inbred CC progeny. We identified a locus, containing 164 genes, linked to DA concentration in the dorsal striatum on chromosome X. We used RNAseq profiling of the ventral midbrain of two founders with substantial difference in striatal DA-C56BL/6\\xa0J and A/J-to highlight potential protein-coding candidates modulating this trait. Among the five differentially expressed genes within the locus, we found that the gene coding for the collagen IV alpha 6 chain (Col4a6) was expressed nine times less in A/J than in C57BL/6J. Using single cell RNA-seq data from developing human midbrain, we found that COL4A6 is highly expressed in radial glia-like cells and neuronal progenitors, indicating a role in neuronal development. Collagen IV alpha-6 chain (COL4A6) controls axogenesis in simple model organisms. Consistent with these findings, A/J mice had less striatal axonal branching than C57BL/6J mice. We tentatively conclude that DA concentration and axonal branching in dorsal striatum are modulated by COL4A6, possibly during development. Our study shows that genetic mapping based on an easily measured Central Nervous System (CNS) trait, using the CC population, combined with follow-up observations, can parse heritability of such a trait, and nominate novel functions for commonly expressed proteins.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common causes of dementia in elderly people, is characterized by progressive impairment in cognitive function, early degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), abnormal metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ) depositions, and neurofibrillary tangles. According to the cholinergic hypothesis, dysfunction of acetylcholine-containing neurons in the basal forebrain contributes markedly to the cognitive decline observed in AD. In addition, the neurotrophic factor hypothesis posits that the loss nerve growth factor (NGF) signalling in AD may account for the vulnerability to atrophy of BFCNs and consequent impairment of cholinergic functions. Though acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide only partial and symptomatic relief to AD patients, emerging data from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients highlight the early involvement of BFCNs in MCI and the early phase of AD. These data support the cholinergic and neurotrophic hypotheses of AD and suggest new targets for AD therapy.Different mechanisms account for selective vulnerability of BFCNs to AD pathology, with regard to altered metabolism of APP and tau. In this review, we provide a general overview of the current knowledge of NGF and APP interplay, focusing on the role of APP in regulating NGF receptors trafficking/signalling and on the involvement of NGF in modulating phosphorylation of APP, which in turn controls APP intracellular trafficking and processing. Moreover, we highlight the consequences of APP interaction with p75NTR and TrkA\\xa0receptor, which share the same binding site within the APP juxta-membrane domain. We underline the importance of insulin dysmetabolism in AD pathology, in the light of our recent data showing that overlapping intracellular signalling pathways stimulated by NGF or insulin can be compensatory. In particular, NGF-based signalling is able to\\xa0ameliorates deficiencies in insulin signalling in the medial septum of 3×Tg-AD mice. Finally, we present an overview of NGF-regulated microRNAs (miRNAs). These small non-coding RNAs are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression , and we focus on a subset that are specifically deregulated in AD and thus potentially contribute to its pathology.\",\n",

However, NMDARs exist within the molecular context of a variety of postsynaptic signaling proteins, which can fine-tune their function. Here, we describe a form of NMDAR suppression by large-conductance Ca- and voltage-gated K (BK) channels in the basal dendrites of a subset of barrel cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We show that NMDAR activation increases intracellular Ca in the vicinity of BK channels, thus activating K efflux and strong negative feedback inhibition. We further show that neurons exhibiting such NMDAR-BK coupling serve as high-pass filters for incoming synaptic inputs, precluding the induction of spike timing-dependent plasticity. Together, these data suggest that NMDAR-localized BK channels regulate synaptic integration and provide input-specific synaptic diversity to a thalamocortical circuit.',\n",

Over the past decade, application of these tools in preclinical models of psychiatric disease has advanced our understanding the neural circuit basis of maladaptive behaviors in these disorders. Despite their power as an investigational tool, optogenetics cannot yet be applied in the clinical for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To date, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the only clinical treatment that can be used to achieve circuit-specific neuromodulation in the context of psychiatric. Despite its increasing clinical indications, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS for psychiatric disorders are poorly understood, which makes optimization difficult. We discuss the variety of optogenetic tools available for preclinical research, and how these tools have been leveraged to reverse-engineer the mechanisms underlying DBS for movement and compulsive disorders. We review studies that have used optogenetics to induce plasticity within defined basal ganglia circuits, to alter neural circuit function and evaluate the corresponding effects on motor and compulsive behaviors. While not immediately applicable to patient populations, the translational power of optogenetics is in inspiring novel DBS protocols by providing a rationale for targeting defined neural circuits to ameliorate specific behavioral symptoms, and by establishing optimal stimulation paradigms that could selectively compensate for pathological synaptic plasticity within these defined neural circuits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The communication between the brain and the immune system is a cornerstone in animal physiology. This interaction is mediated by immune factors acting in both health and pathogenesis, but it is unclear how these systems molecularly and mechanistically communicate under changing environmental conditions. Behavioural fever is a well-conserved immune response that promotes dramatic changes in gene expression patterns during ectotherms' thermoregulatory adaptation, including those orchestrating inflammation. However, the molecular regulators activating the inflammatory reflex in ectotherms remain unidentified. We revisited behavioural fever by providing groups of fish a thermal gradient environment during infection. Our novel experimental setup created temperature ranges in which fish freely moved between different thermal gradients: (1) wide thermoregulatory range; T° = 6.4 °C; and (2) restricted thermoregulatory range; T° = 1.4 °C. The fish behaviour was investigated during 5-days post-viral infection. Blood, spleen, and brain samples were collected to determine plasmatic pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. To characterize genes' functioning during behavioural fever, we performed a transcriptomic profiling of the fish spleen. We also measured the activity of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and acetylcholine in brain and peripheral tissues. We describe the first set of the neural components that control inflammatory modulation during behavioural fever. We identified a neuro-immune crosstalk as a potential mechanism promoting the fine regulation of inflammation. The development of behavioural fever upon viral infection triggers a robust inflammatory response in vivo, establishing an activation threshold after infection in several organs, including the brain. Thus, temperature shifts strongly impact on neural tissue, specifically on the inflammatory reflex network activation. At the molecular level, behavioural fever causes a significant increase in cholinergic neurotransmitters and their receptors' activity and key anti-inflammatory factors such as cytokine Il10 and Tgfβ in target tissues. These results reveal a cholinergic neuronal-based mechanism underlying anti-inflammatory responses under induced fever. We performed the first molecular characterization of the behavioural fever response and inflammatory reflex activation in mobile ectotherms, identifying the role of key regulators of these processes. These findings provide genetic entry points for functional studies of the neural-immune adaptation to infection and its protective relevance in ectotherm organisms. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human stem cell-derived neurons are increasingly considered powerful models in drug discovery and disease modeling, despite limited characterization of their molecular properties. Here, we have conducted a detailed study of the properties of a commercial human induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-derived neuron line, iCell [GABA] neurons, maintained for up to 3 months in vitro. We confirmed that iCell neurons display neurite outgrowth within 24 h of plating and label for the pan-neuronal marker, βIII tubulin within the first week. Our multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings clearly showed neurons generated spontaneous, spike-like activity within 2 days of plating, which peaked at one week, and rapidly decreased over the second week to remain at low levels up to one month. Extracellularly recorded spikes were reversibly inhibited by tetrodotoxin. Patch-clamp experiments showed that iCell neurons generated spontaneous action potentials and expressed voltage-gated Na and K channels with membrane capacitances, resistances and membrane potentials that are consistent with native neurons. Our single neuron recordings revealed that reduced spiking observed in the MEA after the first week results from development of a dominant inhibitory tone from GABAergic neuron circuit maturation. GABA evoked concentration-dependent currents that were inhibited by the convulsants, bicuculline and picrotoxin, and potentiated by the positive allosteric modulators, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, phenobarbital, allopregnanolone and mefenamic acid, consistent with native neuronal GABA receptors. We also show that glycine evoked robust concentration-dependent currents that were inhibited by the neurotoxin, strychnine. Glutamate, AMPA, Kainate and NMDA each evoked concentration-dependent currents in iCell neurons that were blocked by their selective antagonists, consistent with the expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The NMDA currents required the presence of the co-agonist glycine and were blocked in a highly voltage-dependent manner by Mg consistent with the properties of native neuronal NMDA receptors. Together, our data suggest that such human iPSC-derived neurons may have significant value in drug discovery and development and may eventually largely replace the need for animal tissues in human biomedical research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It was recently shown that kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular area (AVPV) orchestrate female sexual behavior, including lordosis behavior and mate preference. A potential target of AVPV kisspeptin signaling could be neurons expressing the neuronal form of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl). Therefore, in the present study, we further refined the role of the VHMvl in female sexual behavior. Adult female mice received a bilateral cannula aimed at the VMHvl. A single injection with kisspeptin (Kp-10) or SNAP/BAY, a nitric oxide donor, significantly increased lordosis, whereas the nNOS inhibitor l-NAME decreased it. None of these drugs affected mate preference. Interestingly, administration of GnRH into the VMHvl had no effect on lordosis or mate preference. To determine whether the stimulatory effect of Kp-10 on lordosis was specific to the VMHvl, an additional group of females received Kp-10 directly into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). No effect was found on lordosis and mate preference. These results suggest that kisspeptin most likely modulates lordosis behavior through nNOS neurons in the VMHvl whereas mate preference is modulated by kisspeptin through a separate neuronal circuit not including the VMHvl.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding the operation of neurons and synapses is essential to reproducing biological computation. Building artificial neuromorphic networks opens the door to a new generation of faster and low-energy-consuming electronic circuits for computation. The main candidates to imitate the natural biocomputation processes, such as the generation of action potentials and spiking, are memristors. Generally, the study of the performance of material neuromorphic elements is done by the analysis of time transient signals. Here, we present an analysis of neural systems in the frequency domain by small-amplitude ac impedance spectroscopy. We start from the constitutive equations for the conductance and memory effect, and we derive and classify the impedance spectroscopy spectra. We first provide a general analysis of a memristor and demonstrate that this element can be expressed as a combination of simple parts. In particular, we derive a basic equivalent circuit where the memory effect is represented by an RL branch. We show that this ac model is quite general and describes the inductive/negative capacitance response in many systems such as halide perovskites and organic LEDs. Thereafter, we derive the impedance response of the integrate-and-fire exponential adaptative neuron model that introduces a negative differential resistance and a richer set of spectra. On the basis of these insights, we provide an interpretation of the varied spectra that appear in the more general Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model. Our work provides important criteria to determine the properties that must be found in material realizations of neuronal elements. This approach has the great advantage that the analysis of highly complex phenomena can be based purely on the shape of experimental impedance spectra, avoiding the need for specific modeling of rather involved material processes that produce the required response.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Light regulates daily sleep rhythms by a neural circuit that connects intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) to the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Light, however, also acutely affects sleep in a circadian-independent manner. The neural circuits involving the acute effect of light on sleep remain unknown. Here we uncovered a neural circuit that drives this acute light response, independent of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, but still through ipRGCs. We show that ipRGCs substantially innervate the preoptic area (POA) to mediate the acute light effect on sleep in mice. Consistently, activation of either the POA projecting ipRGCs or the light-responsive POA neurons increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep without influencing REM sleep. In addition, inhibition of the light-responsive POA neurons blocked the acute light effects on NREM sleep. The predominant light-responsive POA neurons that receive ipRGC input belong to the corticotropin-releasing hormone subpopulation. Remarkably, the light-responsive POA neurons are inhibitory and project to well-known wakefulness-promoting brain regions, such as the tuberomammillary nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus. Therefore, activation of the ipRGC-POA circuit inhibits arousal brain regions to drive light-induced NREM sleep. Our findings reveal a functional retina-brain circuit that is both necessary and sufficient for the acute effect of light on sleep.',\n",

Although much progress has been made in designing circuit elements that mimic the behavior of neurons and synapses, challenges remain in designing networks of elements that feature a collective response behavior. We present simulations of networks of circuits and devices based on superconducting and Mott-insulating oxides that display a multiplicity of emergent states that depend on the spatial configuration of the network. Our proposed network designs are based on experimentally known ways of tuning the properties of these oxides using light ions. We show how neuronal and synaptic behavior can be achieved with arrays of superconducting Josephson junction loops, all within the same device. We also show how a multiplicity of synaptic states could be achieved by designing arrays of devices based on hydrogenated rare earth nickelates.

Although this is thought to be mediated by homeostatic plasticity, what aspect of neural activity is conserved and how the flexibility necessary for learning and memory is maintained is not fully understood. Experimental studies suggest that there exists network-centered, in addition to the well-studied neuron-centered, control. Here we computationally study such a potential mechanism: input-dependent inhibitory plasticity (IDIP). In a hippocampal model, we show that IDIP can explain the emergence of active and silent place cells as well as remapping following silencing of active place cells. Furthermore, we show that IDIP can also stabilize recurrent dynamics while preserving firing rate heterogeneity and stimulus representation, as well as persistent activity after memory encoding. Hence, the establishment of global network balance with IDIP has diverse functional implications and may be able to explain experimental phenomena across different brain areas.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Optogenetics allows the experimental manipulation of excitable cells by a light stimulus without the need for technically challenging and invasive procedures. The high degree of spatial, temporal, and intensity control that can be achieved with a light stimulus, combined with cell type-specific expression of light-sensitive ion channels, enables highly specific and precise stimulation of excitable cells. Optogenetic tools have therefore revolutionized the study of neuronal circuits in a number of models, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Despite the existence of several optogenetic systems that allow spatial and temporal photoactivation of light-sensitive actuators in C. elegans, their high costs and low flexibility have limited wide access to optogenetics. Here, we developed an inexpensive, easy-to-build, modular, and adjustable optogenetics device for use on different microscopes and worm trackers, which we called the OptoArm. The OptoArm allows for single- and multiple-worm illumination and is adaptable in terms of light intensity, lighting profiles, and light color. We demonstrate OptoArm's power in a population-based multi-parameter study on the contributions of motor circuit cells to age-related motility decline. We found that individual components of the neuromuscular system display different rates of age-dependent deterioration. The functional decline of cholinergic neurons mirrors motor decline, while GABAergic neurons and muscle cells are relatively age-resilient, suggesting that rate-limiting cells exist and determine neuronal circuit ageing. We have assembled an economical, reliable, and highly adaptable optogenetics system which can be deployed to address diverse biological questions. We provide a detailed description of the construction as well as technical and biological validation of our set-up. Importantly, use of the OptoArm is not limited to C. elegans and may benefit studies in multiple model organisms, making optogenetics more accessible to the broader research community. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Migraine attacks can involve changes of appetite: while fasting or skipping meals are often reported triggers in susceptible individuals, hunger or food craving are reported in the premonitory phase. Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest and recognition of the importance of studying these overlapping fields of neuroscience, which has led to novel findings. The data suggest additional studies are needed to unravel key neurobiological mechanisms underlying the bidirectional interaction between migraine and appetite. Herein, we review information about the metabolic migraine phenotype and explore migraine therapeutic targets that have a strong input on appetite neuronal circuits, including the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and the orexins. Furthermore, we focus on potential therapeutic peptide targets that are involved in regulation of feeding and play a role in migraine pathophysiology, such as neuropeptide Y, insulin, glucagon and leptin. We then examine the orexigenic - anorexigenic circuit feedback loop and explore glucose metabolism disturbances. Additionally, it is proposed a different perspective on the most reported feeding-related trigger - skipping meals - as well as a link between contrasting feeding behaviors (skipping meals vs food craving). Our review aims to increase awareness of migraine through the lens of appetite neurobiology in order to improve our understanding of the earlier phase of migraine, encourage better studies and cross-disciplinary collaborations, and provide novel migraine-specific therapeutic opportunities.',\n",

In the central nervous system, stem cell-driven repair is slow and problematic because function needs to be restored rapidly for vital tasks. In highly regenerative vertebrates, such as zebrafish, functional recovery is rapid, suggesting a capability for fast cell production and functional integration. Surprisingly, we found that migration of dormant \"precursor neurons\" to the injury site pioneers functional circuit regeneration after spinal cord injury and controls the subsequent stem-cell-driven repair response. Thus, the precursor neurons make do before the stem cells make new. Furthermore, RNA released from the dying or damaged cells at the site of injury acts as a signal to attract precursor neurons for repair.

       "  'abstract': \"Migraine is a complex neurological disorder affecting approximately 12% of the population. The pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, however the clinical features of the disease, such as the cyclic behaviour of attacks and vegetative symptoms, suggest a prominent role of the hypothalamus. Previous research has observed neuronal alterations at different time points during the migraine interval, specifically just before the headache is initiated. We therefore aimed to assess the trajectory of migraineurs' brain activity over an entire migraine cycle. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (ASL), we designed a longitudinal intra-individual study to detect the rhythmicity of (1) the cerebral perfusion and (2) the hypothalamic connectivity over an entire migraine cycle. Twelve episodic migraine patients were examined in 82 sessions during spontaneous headache attacks with follow-up recordings towards the next attack. We detected cyclic changes of brain perfusion in the limbic circuit (insula and nucleus accumbens), with the highest perfusion during the headache attack. In addition, we found an increase of hypothalamic connectivity to the limbic system over the interictal interval towards the attack, then collapsing during the headache phase. The present data provide strong evidence for the predominant role of the hypothalamus in generating migraine attacks. Due to a genetically-determined cortical hyperexcitability, migraineurs are most likely characterised by an increased susceptibility of limbic neurons to the known migraine trigger. The hypothalamus as a metronome of internal processes is suggested to control these limbic circuits: migraine attacks may occur as a result of the hypothalamus losing control over the limbic system. Repetitive psychosocial stress, one of the leading trigger factors reported by patients, might make the limbic system even more vulnerable and lead to a premature triggering of a migraine attack. Potential therapeutic interventions are therefore suggested to strengthen limbic circuits with dedicated medication or psychological approaches.\",\n",

The fluctuation in maternal 5-HT affects fetal neurogenesis with life-long consequences, however, its mechanisms have not been well known. The chicken embryo, independent of maternal neurohormonal influence, may offer an ideal model for studying the mechanisms of prenatal 5-HT exposure altering postnatal physiological homeostasis and behavioral exhibition. To investigate the fine-tuning of 5-HT to the early embryonic neurodevelopment, 10\\xa0µg and 20\\xa0µg 5-HT were secretively injected to chicken embryos before incubation. 5-HT exposure mainly affected the neural development in the pons and midbrain, altered the serotoninergic and dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal morphology, nucleus distribution, and their metabolisms and related gene expressions. The comprehensive effect of 5-HT exposure was not dosage-dependent but the working pathways differed, 10\\xa0µg 5-HT exposure reduced 5-HT turnover rate, increased 5-HT 1a receptor expression, and facilitated the ventral tegmental area neuronal development; while 20\\xa0µg 5-HT exposure increased the serotoninergic and DAergic neurotransmission and enhanced serotoninergic regulation to the hypothalamus. These findings indicate that the 5-HT exposure effect can be achieved via different paths by modifying the embryonic serotonergic (5-HTergic) and DAergic systems and altering fetal 5-HTergic influence on the thalamocortical circuit and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These results may offer a novel sight for understanding the function of 5-HT during neurodevelopment and raise the possibility for using selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors to regulate emotional and mental wellness during early pregnancy and possible risks of complications for babies.',\n",

Development of these tools is crucial for understanding complex behaviors and cognition and for advancing clinical applications. However, it remains a challenge to densely record from cell populations stably and continuously over long time periods. Many popular electrodes, such as tetrodes and silicon arrays, feature large cross-diameters that produce damage upon insertion and elicit chronic reactive tissue responses associated with neuronal death, hindering the recording of stable, continuous neural activity. In addition, most wire bundles exhibit broad spacing between channels, precluding simultaneous recording from a large number of cells clustered in a small area. The carbon fiber microelectrode arrays described in this protocol offer an accessible solution to these concerns. The study provides a detailed method for fabricating carbon fiber microelectrode arrays that can be used for both acute and chronic recordings in vivo. The physical properties of these electrodes make them ideal for stable and continuous long-term recordings at high cell densities, enabling the researcher to make robust, unambiguous recordings from single units across months.',\n",

Here we show that  ()-expressing neurons in the hypothalamic perifornical area (PeFA) are activated during infant-directed attacks in males and females, but not other behaviors. Functional manipulations of PeFA neurons demonstrate the role of this population in the negative control of parenting in both sexes. PeFA neurons receive input from areas associated with vomeronasal sensing, stress, and parenting, and send projections to hypothalamic and limbic areas. Optogenetic activation of PeFA axon terminals in these regions triggers various aspects of infant-directed agonistic responses, such as neglect, repulsion, and aggression. Thus, PeFA neurons emerge as a dedicated circuit component controlling infant-directed neglect and aggression, providing a new framework to understand the positive and negative regulation of parenting in health and disease.',\n",

One aspect of this control is modulation of neuronal activity through cholinergic signaling. Nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn express both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors and activation of these receptors reduces pain in humans, while inhibition leads to nociceptive hypersensitivity. At a cellular level, acetylcholine (ACh) has diverse effects on excitability which is dependent on the receptor and neuronal subtypes involved. In the present study we sought to characterize the electrophysiological responses of specific subsets of lamina II interneurons from rat and marmoset spinal cord. Neurons were grouped by morphology and by action potential firing properties. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from lamina II dorsal horn neurons of adult rats showed that bath applied acetylcholine increased, decreased or had no effect on spontaneous synaptic current activity in a cell-type specific manner. ACh modulated inhibitory synaptic activity in 80% of neurons, whereas excitatory synaptic activity was affected in less than 50% of neurons. In whole-cell current clamp recordings, brief somatic application of ACh induced cell-type specific responses in 79% of rat lamina II neurons, which included: depolarization and action potential firing, subthreshold membrane depolarization, biphasic responses characterized by transient depolarization followed by hyperpolarization and membrane hyperpolarization alone. Similar responses were seen in marmoset lamina II neurons and the properties of each neuron group were consistent across species. ACh-induced hyperpolarization was blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine and all forms of acetylcholine-induced depolarization were blocked by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. The cholinergic system plays an important role in regulating nociception and this study contributes to our understanding of how circuit activity is controlled by ACh at a cellular level in primate and rodent spinal cord.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Wnt pathway is a key signalling cascade that regulates the formation and function of neuronal circuits. The main receptors for Wnts are Frizzled (Fzd) that mediate diverse functions such as neurogenesis, axon guidance, dendritogenesis, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity. These processes are crucial for the assembly of functional neuronal circuits required for diverse functions ranging from sensory and motor tasks to cognitive performance. Indeed, aberrant Wnt-Fzd signalling has been associated with synaptic defects during development and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. New studies suggest that the localisation and stability of Fzd receptors play a crucial role in determining Wnt function. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Fzd are emerging as an important mechanism that regulates these Wnt receptors. However, only phosphorylation and glycosylation have been described to modulate Fzd function in the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we discuss the function of Fzd in neuronal circuit connectivity and how PTMs contribute to their function. We also discuss other PTMs, not yet described in the CNS, and how they might modulate the function of Fzd in neuronal connectivity. PTMs could modulate Fzd function by affecting Fzd localisation and stability at the plasma membrane resulting in local effects of Wnt signalling, a feature particularly important in polarised cells such as neurons. Our review highlights the importance of further studies into the role of PTMs on Fzd receptors in the context of neuronal connectivity.\",\n",

Here, the dose-dependent effects of a purified alkaloid kratom extract on neuronal oscillatory systems function, analgesia, and antidepressant-like behaviour were evaluated and kratom-induced changes in ΔFosB expression determined. Male rats were administered a low or high dose of kratom (containing 0.5 or 1\\xa0mg/kg of mitragynine, respectively) for seven days. Acute or repeated low dose kratom suppressed ventral tegmental area (VTA) theta oscillatory power whereas acute or repeated high dose kratom increased delta power, and reduced theta power, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex (Cg) and VTA. The repeated administration of low dose kratom additionally elevated delta power in PFC, decreased theta power in NAc and PFC, and suppressed beta and low gamma power in Cg. Suppressed high gamma power in NAc and PFC was seen selectively following repeated high dose kratom. Both doses of kratom elevated NAc-PFC, VTA-NAc, and VTA-Cg coherence. Low dose kratom had antidepressant-like properties whereas both doses produced analgesia. No kratom-induced changes in ΔFosB expression were evident. These results support a role for kratom as having both antidepressant and analgesic properties that are accompanied by specific changes in neuronal circuit function. However, the absence of drug-induced changes in ΔFosB expression suggest that the drug may circumvent this cellular signaling pathway, a pathway known for its significant role in addiction.',\n",

While electrophysiological studies provide useful information concerning the properties of such synaptic circuits, they typically involve tissue disruption and do not correlate circuit activity with biochemically defined neuronal phenotypes. To overcome these limitations, mice were engineered to express the sensitive, fast Ca indicator GCaMP6f selectively in neurons that express the acetylcholine (ACh) biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransfarse (ChAT) thereby allowing rapid activity-driven changes in Ca fluorescence to be observed without disrupting intrinsic connections, solely in cholinergic myenteric ganglion (MG) neurons. Experiments with selective receptor agonists and antagonists reveal that most mouse colonic cholinergic (i.e., GCaMP6f/ChAT) MG neurons express nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs), particularly the ganglionic subtype containing α3 and β4 subunits, and most express ionotropic serotonin receptors (5-HTRs). Cholinergic MG neurons also display small, spontaneous Ca transients occurring at ≈ 0.2 Hz. Experiments with inhibitors of Na channel dependent impulses, presynaptic Ca channels and postsynaptic receptor function reveal that the Ca transients arise from impulse-driven presynaptic activity and subsequent activation of postsynaptic nAChRs or 5-HTRs. Electrical stimulation of axonal connectives to MG evoked Ca responses in the neurons that similarly depended on nAChRs or/and 5-HTRs. Responses to single connective shocks had peak amplitudes and rise and decay times that were indistinguishable from the spontaneous Ca transients and the largest fraction had brief synaptic delays consistent with activation by monosynaptic inputs. These results indicate that the spontaneous Ca transients and stimulus evoked Ca responses in MG neurons originate in circuits involving fast chemical synaptic transmission mediated by nAChRs or/and 5-HTRs. Experiments with an α7-nAChR agonist and antagonist, and with pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) reveal that the same synaptic circuits display extensive capacity for presynaptic modulation. Our use of non-invasive GCaMP6f/ChAT Ca imaging in colon segments with intrinsic connections preserved, reveals an abundance of direct and modulatory synaptic influences on cholinergic MG neurons.',\n",

Interactions between the nervous and immune systems have recently emerged as important regulators of host defence and inflammation. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether neuronal and immune cells co-operate in brain-body axes to orchestrate metabolism and obesity. Here we describe a neuro-mesenchymal unit that controls group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), adipose tissue physiology, metabolism and obesity via a brain-adipose circuit. We found that sympathetic nerve terminals act on neighbouring adipose mesenchymal cells via the β2-adrenergic receptor to control the expression of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the activity of ILC2s in gonadal fat. Accordingly, ILC2-autonomous manipulation of the GDNF receptor machinery led to alterations in ILC2 function, energy expenditure, insulin resistance and propensity to obesity. Retrograde tracing and chemical, surgical and chemogenetic manipulations identified a sympathetic aorticorenal circuit that modulates ILC2s in gonadal fat and connects to higher-order brain areas, including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Our results identify a neuro-mesenchymal unit that translates cues from long-range neuronal circuitry into adipose-resident ILC2 function, thereby shaping host metabolism and obesity.',\n",

There are profound changes in peripheral sensory neurons after injury, but how patterned neuronal activities in the CNS encode injury-induced sensitization to temperature stimuli is largely unknown. Using  calcium imaging and mouse genetics, we show that formalin- and prostaglandin E-induced inflammation dramatically increase spinal responses to heating and decrease responses to cooling in male and female mice. The reduction of cold response is largely eliminated on ablation of TRPV1-expressing primary sensory neurons, indicating a crossover inhibition of cold response from the hyperactive heat inputs in the spinal cord. Interestingly, chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin can rapidly increase spinal responses to cooling and suppress responses to heating. Together, our results suggest a push-pull mechanism in processing cold and heat inputs and reveal a synergic mechanism to shift thermosensation after injury. In this paper, we combine our novel  spinal cord two-photon calcium imaging, mouse genetics, and persistent pain models to study how tissue injury alters the sensation of temperature. We discover modality-specific changes of spinal temperature responses in different models of injury. Chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin leads to cold hypersensitivity and heat hyposensitivity. By contrast, inflammation increases heat sensitivity and decreases cold sensitivity. This decrease in cold sensitivity results from the stronger crossover inhibition from the hyperactive heat inputs. Our work reveals the bidirectional change of thermosensitivity by injury and suggests that the crossover inhibitory circuit underlies the shifted thermosensation, providing a mechanism to the biased perception toward a unique thermal modality that was observed clinically in chronic pain patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used to maintain general anesthesia. At anesthetic doses, ketamine causes high power gamma (25-50 Hz) oscillations alternating with slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations. These dynamics are readily observed in local field potentials (LFPs) of non-human primates (NHPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from human subjects. However, a detailed statistical analysis of these dynamics has not been reported. We characterize ketamine's neural dynamics using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM observations are sequences of spectral power in seven canonical frequency bands between 0 to 50 Hz, where power is averaged within each band and scaled between 0 and 1. We model the observations as realizations of multivariate beta probability distributions that depend on a discrete-valued latent state process whose state transitions obey Markov dynamics. Using an expectation-maximization algorithm, we fit this beta-HMM to LFP recordings from 2 NHPs, and separately, to EEG recordings from 9 human subjects who received anesthetic doses of ketamine. Our beta-HMM framework provides a useful tool for experimental data analysis. Together, the estimated beta-HMM parameters and optimal state trajectory revealed an alternating pattern of states characterized primarily by gamma and slow-delta activities. The mean duration of the gamma activity was 2.2s([1.7,2.8]s) and 1.2s([0.9,1.5]s) for the two NHPs, and 2.5s([1.7,3.6]s) for the human subjects. The mean duration of the slow-delta activity was 1.6s([1.2,2.0]s) and 1.0s([0.8,1.2]s) for the two NHPs, and 1.8s([1.3,2.4]s) for the human subjects. Our characterizations of the alternating gamma slow-delta activities revealed five sub-states that show regular sequential transitions.

Three interneurons, Tm2, Tm9 and CT1, provide information about ON stimuli to the OFF direction-selective neuron T5 across its receptive field, supporting a contrast-opponent receptive field organization.

Previous studies focusing on experience-dependent plasticity of neurons have revealed a variety of mechanisms underlying cortical circuit rewiring. Emerging evidence shows that astrocytes play important roles in shaping cortical circuits through extensive interactions with different types of neurons and other glia cells. However, it remains unclear how astrocytes respond to sensory experience during postnatal development. In the present study, we profiled the maturation of astrocytes in the primary visual cortex (V1) at different postnatal stages. We then investigated the anatomical and physiological changes of astrocytes in V1 induced by multiple types of visual experience within 4 postnatal weeks. Compared with monocular deprivation during the critical period, binocular deprivation showed stronger impact on reactive astrocytes in V1. Moreover, long-term binocular deprivation significantly reduced the density of reactive astrocytes in layer 2/3 of V1 while strengthening gap junction couplings between astrocytes at the same time. Therefore, our data demonstrated that cortical astrocytes could undergo homeostatic plasticity in response to long-term changes of sensory inputs. The plasticity of astrocytes may interact with the plasticity of neurons to cooperatively shape cortical circuit refinement during postnatal development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Synchronization between neuronal populations is hypothesized to play a crucial role in the communication between brain networks. The binding of features, or the association of computations occurring in spatially segregated areas, is supposed to take place when a stable synchronization between cortical areas occurs. While a direct cortico-cortical connection typically fails to support this mechanism, the participation of a third area, a relay element, mediating in the communication was proposed to overcome this limitation. Among the different structures that could play the role of coordination during the binding process, the thalamus is the best placed region to carry out this task. In this paper we study how information flows in a canonical motif that mimics a cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit composed by three mutually coupled neuronal populations (also called the V-motif). Through extensive numerical simulations, we found that the amount of information transferred between the oscillating neuronal populations is determined by the delay in their connections and the mismatch in their oscillation frequencies (detuning). While the transmission from a cortical population is mostly restricted to positive detuning, transmission from the relay (thalamic) population to the cortical populations is robust for a broad range of detuning values, including negative values, while permitting feedback communication from the cortex at high frequencies, thus supporting robust bottom up and top down interaction. In this case, a strong feedback transmission between the cortex to thalamus supports the possibility of robust bottom-up and top-down interactions in this motif. Interestingly, adding a cortico-cortical bidirectional connection to the V-motif (C-motif) expands the dynamics of the system with distinct operation modes. While overall transmission efficiency is decreased, new communication channels establish cortico-thalamo-cortical association loops. Switching between operation modes depends on the synaptic strength of the cortico-cortical connections. Our results support a role of the transthalamic V-motif in the binding of spatially segregated cortical computations, and suggest an important regulatory role of the direct cortico-cortical connection.',\n",

This characterization is carried out in terms of an electric circuit model containing monomeric flow resistances and ionic capacitances in both the condensed and diffuse layers.

However, the neural circuitry involved in vocal production is not fully understood. In addition, even less is known about the involvement of astrocytes in this circuit. To understand the role, that astrocytes may play in the complex behavior of vocalization, the initial step may be to study their structural properties in the cortical and subcortical regions that are known to be involved in vocalization. Here, in the common marmoset, we identify all astrocytic subtypes seen in other primate's brains, including intralaminar astrocytes. In addition, we reveal detailed structural characteristics of astrocytes and perform morphometric analysis of astrocytes residing in the cortex and midbrain regions that are associated with vocal production. We found that cortical astrocytes in these regions illustrate a higher level of complexity when compared to those in the midbrain.

This process is estradiol-dependent and occurs on the afternoon of proestrus in female mice. On proestrus, AVPV kisspeptin neurons express more kisspeptin and exhibit higher frequency action potentials and burst firing compared with diestrus, which is characterized by a pulsatile rather than a prolonged surge of GnRH secretion. We hypothesized changes in voltage-gated potassium conductances shape activity profiles of these cells in a cycle-dependent manner. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of GFP-identified AVPV kisspeptin neurons in brain slices from diestrous and proestrous mice revealed three subcomponents of the voltage-sensitive K current: fast-transient slow-transient, and residual. During proestrus, the V of inactivation of the fast-transient current was depolarized and the amplitude of the slow-transient component was reduced compared with diestrus; the residual component was consistent across both stages. Computational models were fit to experimental data, including published estrous-cycle effects on other voltage-gated currents. Computer simulations suggest proestrus-typical K currents are suppressive compared with diestrus. Interestingly, larger T-type, persistent-sodium, and hyperpolarization-activated currents during proestrus compensate for this suppressive effect while also enabling postinhibitory rebound bursting. These findings suggest modulation of voltage-gated K and multiple subthreshold depolarizing currents across the negative to positive feedback transition maintain AVPV kisspeptin neuron excitability in response to depolarizing stimuli. These changes also enable firing in response to hyperpolarization, providing a net increase in neuronal excitability, which may contribute to activation of this population leading up to the preovulatory GnRH surge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Throughout development, neuronal identity is controlled by key transcription factors that determine the unique properties of a cell. During embryogenesis, the transcription factor Prox1 regulates VIP-positive cortical interneuron migration, survival, and connectivity. Here, we explore the role of Prox1 as a regulator of genetic programs that guide the final specification of VIP interneuron subtypes in early postnatal life. Synaptic  electrophysiology in male and female mice shows that postnatal Prox1 removal differentially affects the dynamics of excitatory inputs onto VIP bipolar and multipolar subtypes. RNA sequencing reveals that one of the downstream targets of Prox1 is the postsynaptic protein Elfn1, a constitutive regulator of presynaptic release probability. Further genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that removing Prox1 reduces Elfn1 function in VIP multipolar but not in bipolar cells. Finally, overexpression experiments and analysis of native  mRNA expression reveal that Elfn1 levels are differentially controlled at the post-transcriptional stage. Thus, in addition to activity-dependent processes that contribute to the developmental trajectory of VIP cells, genetic programs engaged by Prox1 control the final differentiation of multipolar and bipolar subtypes. The transcription factor Prox1 generates functional diversification of cortical VIP interneuron subtypes in early postnatal life, thus expanding the inhibitory repertoire of the cortex.',\n",

Elucidating key neural circuits involved in recovery will be invaluable for translating neuromodulation strategies after stroke. Here, we used optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain-wide neural circuit dynamics after stroke in mice treated with and without optogenetic excitatory neuronal stimulations in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1). We identified key sensorimotor circuits affected by stroke. iM1 stimulation treatment restored activation of the ipsilesional corticothalamic and corticocortical circuits, and the extent of activation was correlated with functional recovery. Furthermore, stimulated mice exhibited higher expression of axonal growth-associated protein 43 in the ipsilesional thalamus and showed increased Synaptophysin/channelrhodopsin presynaptic axonal terminals in the corticothalamic circuit. Selective stimulation of the corticothalamic circuit was sufficient to improve functional recovery. Together, these findings suggest early involvement of corticothalamic circuit as an important mediator of poststroke recovery.',\n",

The motor loop starts from the cortex, travels through the BG and thalamus, and returns to the same area of the cortex with somatotopic organization. The striatum is the major input nucleus of the cortex, and the internal segment of the globus pallidus(GPi)is the main output nucleus. BG is explained by the direct and indirect pathways, and these excitatory or inhibitory pathways are used for several disease models. In Parkinson's disease(PD), dopamine deficiency acts on both direct and indirect pathways to cause the neuronal activity of GPi to becomes disinhibited. Pallidotomy, an effective surgery to improve Parkinsonism, aimed to destroy this hyperactive state. This is based on the rate model. However, a simian PD model with MPTP-treated monkeys exhibited increased GPi activity during effective stimulation of subtalamic nucleus(STN)-DBS, which makes it difficult to explain the pathophysiology of PD based only on the rate model. Instead, the alterative model is now widely prevailing. Local field potentials recorded from the DBS leads implanted in GPi and/or STN uncovered the abnormally synchronized activity in the β range(β oscillation)and abnormal co-synchronization between these nuclei, which is believed to be important in the pathophysiology of PD.\",\n",

In response to novelty, interactions across the VTA-hippocampal circuit support experience-dependent plasticity in the hippocampus. While theories have broadly suggested plasticity-related changes are also instantiated in the cortex, research has also shown evidence for functional heterogeneity in cortical networks. It therefore remains unclear how the hippocampal-VTA circuit engages cortical networks, and whether novelty targets specific cortical regions or diffuse, large-scale cortical networks. To adjudicate the role of the VTA and hippocampus in cortical network plasticity, we used fMRI to compare resting-state functional coupling before and following exposure to novel scene images in human subjects of both sexes. Functional coupling between right anterior hippocampus and VTA was enhanced following novelty exposure. However, we also found evidence for a double dissociation, with anterior hippocampus and VTA showing distinct patterns of post-novelty functional coupling enhancements, targeting task-relevant regions versus large-scale networks, respectively. Further, significant correlations between these networks and the novelty-related plasticity in the anterior hippocampal-VTA functional network suggest that the central hippocampal-VTA network may facilitate the interactions with the cortex. These findings support an extended model of novelty-induced plasticity, in which novelty elicits plasticity-related changes in both local and global cortical networks. Novelty detection is critical for adaptive behavior, signaling the need to update existing representations. By engaging the bidirectional hippocampal-VTA circuit, novelty has been shown to induce plasticity-related changes in the hippocampus. However, it remains an open question how novelty targets such plasticity-related changes in cortical networks. We show that anterior hippocampus and VTA target cortical networks at different spatial scales, with respective enhancements in post-novelty functional coupling with a task-relevant cortical region and a large-scale memory network. The results presented here support an extended model of novelty-related plasticity, in which engaging the anterior hippocampal-VTA circuit through novelty exposure propagates cortical plasticity through hippocampal and VTA functional pathways at distinct scales, targeting specific or diffuse cortical networks.',\n",

In addition to the extensive Drosophila genetic toolbox, this relative simplicity has allowed decades of work to yield a detailed account of its neuronal type diversity, morphology, connectivity and specification mechanisms. In the past three years, numerous studies have applied large scale single-cell transcriptomic approaches to the Drosophila visual system and have provided access to the complete gene expression profile of most neuronal types throughout development. This makes the fly visual system particularly well suited to perform detailed studies of the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution and development of neuronal systems. Here, we highlight how these transcriptomic resources allow exploring long-standing biological questions under a new light. We first present the efforts made to characterize neuronal diversity in the Drosophila visual system and suggest ways to further improve this description.

We have previously shown histopathological changes in myelination and neuronal density in fetuses with chronic foetal hypoxaemia at a level consistent with CHD. Mid-gestation foetal sheep (110 ± 3 days gestation) were cannulated and attached to a pumpless, low-resistance oxygenator circuit, and incubated in a sterile fluid environment mimicking the intrauterine environment. Fetuses were maintained with an oxygen delivery of 20-25 ml/kg/min (normoxemia) or 14-16 ml/kg/min (hypoxaemia). Myelin Basic Protein and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein serum levels in the two groups were assessed by ELISA at baseline and at 7, 14, and 21 days of support. Based on overlapping 95% confidence intervals, there were no statistically significant differences in either Myelin Basic Protein or Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein serum levels between the normoxemic and hypoxemic groups, at any time point. No statistically significant correlations were observed between oxygen delivery and levels of Myelin Basic Protein and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein. Chronic foetal hypoxaemia during mid-gestation is not associated with elevated serum levels of acute white matter (Myelin Basic Protein) or astrocyte injury (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein), in this model. In conjunction with our previously reported findings, our data support the hypothesis that the brain dysmaturity with impaired myelination found in fetuses with chronic hypoxaemia is caused by disruption of normal developmental pathways rather than by direct cellular injury.

However, there is ample evidence that this region is also involved in regulating aversive responses, but the exact role of the NAc and its subregions in regulating associative fear processing remains unclear. Here, we investigated the specific contribution of the NAcC and NAcS in regulating both fear expression and fear extinction in C57BL/6J mice. Using Arc expression as an indicator of neuronal activity, we first show that the NAcC is specifically active only in response to an associative fear cue during an expression test. In contrast, the NAcS is specifically active during fear extinction. We next inactivated each subregion using lidocaine and demonstrated that the NAcC is necessary for fear expression, but not for extinction learning or consolidation of extinction. In contrast, we demonstrate that the NAcS is necessary for the consolidation of extinction, but not fear expression or extinction learning. Further, inactivation of mGluR1 or ERK signaling specifically in the NAcS disrupted the consolidation of extinction but had no effect on fear expression or extinction learning itself. Our data provide the first evidence for the importance of the ERK/MAPK pathway as the underlying neural mechanism facilitating extinction consolidation within the NAcS. These findings suggest that the NAc subregions play dissociable roles in regulating fear recall and the consolidation of fear extinction, and potentially implicate them as critical regions within the canonical fear circuit.',\n",

To understand the complexity of information processing at synaptic networks will rely in part on effective computational models. Such models should also evaluate disruptions to synaptic function by multiple mechanisms. By co-development of algorithms alongside hardware, real time analysis metrics can be co-prioritized along with biological complexity. The hippocampus is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and within this region glutamatergic neurons constitute 90% of the neurons integral to the functioning of neuronal networks. Here we generate a computational model referred to as ASD interrogator (ASDint) and corresponding hardware to enable in silicon analysis of multiple ASD mechanisms affecting glutamatergic neuron synapses. The hardware architecture Synaptic Neuronal Circuit, SyNC, is a novel GPU accelerator or neural net, that extends discovery by acting as a biologically relevant realistic neuron synapse in real time. Co-developed ASDint and SyNC expand spiking neural network models of plasticity to comparative analysis of retrograde messengers. The SyNC model is realized in an ASIC architecture, which enables the ability to compute increasingly complex scenarios without sacrificing area efficiency of the model. Here we apply the ASDint model to analyse neuronal circuitry dysfunctions associated with autism spectral disorder (ASD) synaptopathies and their effects on the synaptic learning parameter and demonstrate SyNC on an ideal ASDint scenario. Our work highlights the value of secondary pathways in regard to evaluating complex ASD synaptopathy mechanisms. By comparing the degree of variation in the synaptic learning parameter to the response obtained from simulations of the ideal scenario we determine the potency and time of the effect of a particular evaluated mechanism. Hence simulations of such scenarios in even a small neuronal network now allows us to identify relative impacts of changed parameters and their effect on synaptic function. Based on this, we can estimate the minimum fraction of a neuron exhibiting a particular dysfunction scenario required to lead to complete failure of a neural network to coordinate pre-synaptic and post-synaptic outputs.',\n",

Since current noninvasive imaging technologies allow cellular-resolution imaging of neurons only within ~1\\u2009mm below the cortical surface, the majority of mouse brain tissue remains inaccessible. While miniature optical imaging probes allow access to deep brain regions, cellular-resolution imaging is typically restricted to a small tissue volume. To increase the tissue access volume, we developed a clear optically matched panoramic access channel technique (COMPACT). With probe dimensions comparable to those of common gradient-index lenses, COMPACT enables a two to three orders of magnitude greater tissue access volume. We demonstrated the capabilities of COMPACT by multiregional calcium imaging in mice during sleep. We believe that large-volume in vivo imaging with COMPACT will be valuable to a variety of deep tissue imaging applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) techniques and in particular, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), are developing beyond mere clinical application. Although originally purposed for the treatment of resistant neuropsychiatric disorders, NIBS is also contributing to a deeper understanding of psychiatric disorders. rTMS is also changing the model of the disorder itself, from \"mental\" to one of neural connectivity. TMS allows the assessment of brain circuit excitability and eventually, of plastic changes affecting these circuits. While a clinical translational approach is, at the present time, the most adequate to meet the dimensional-circuit base model of the disorder, it refines the standard categorical classification of psychiatric disorders. The discovery of the fundamental importance of the balance between neuroplasticity and inflammation is also now explored through neuro-modulation findings consistently with the evidence of anti-inflammatory actions of the magnetic pulses. rTMS may activate, inhibit, or otherwise interfere with the activity of neuronal cortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and intensity of brain-induced electric field. Of particular interest, yet still unclear, is how the relatively unspecific nature of TMS stimulation may lead to specific neuronal reorganization, as well as a definition of the TMS-triggered reorganization of functional brain modules, raising attention on the importance of the active participation of the patient to the treatment.. Configuration and state of consciousness of the subject have made subjective experience under treatment regain importance in the neuro-scientific Psychiatry based on the requirement of United States National Institute of Health (NIH) and the substantial importance of the consciousness state in the efficacy of the TMS treatment. By focusing on the subjective experience, a renaissance of the phenomenology offers Psychiatry an opportunity to become proficient and to distinguish itself from other disciplines. For all these reasons, TMS should be included in the cluster of the sub-specialties as a new \"Super-Specialty\" and an appropriate training course has to be inaugurated. Psychiatrists are nowadays multi-specialists, moving from a specialty to another, vs super-specialist. The cultivation of a properly trained cohort of TMS psychiatrists will better meet the challenges of treatment-resistant psychiatric conditions (disorders of connectivity), through appropriate and ethical practice, meanwhile facilitating an informed development and integration of additional emerging neuro-modulation techniques. The aim of this consensus paper is to underline the interdisciplinary nature of NIBS, that also encompasses the subjective experience and to point out the necessity of a neuroscience-applied approach to NIBS in the context of the European College of Neuro-psychopharmacology (ECNP).',\n",

However, other nonsynaptic routes of communication are known in invertebrates including extrasynaptic volume transmission (EVT), which enables short- and/or long-range communication in the absence of synaptic connections. Although EVT has been highlighted as a facet of  neurosignaling, no experimental evidence identifies body cavity fluid (pseudocoelomic fluid; PCF) as a vehicle for either neuropeptide or biogenic amine transmission. In the parasitic nematode , FMRFamide-like peptides encoded on  potently stimulate female reproductive organs but are expressed in cells that are anatomically distant from the reproductive organ, with no known synaptic connections to this tissue. Here we investigate nonsynaptic neuropeptide signaling in nematodes mediated by the body cavity fluid. Our data show that (i)  PCF (As-PCF) contains a catalog of neuropeptides including FMRFamide-like peptides and neuropeptide-like proteins, (ii) the  FMRFamide-like peptide As-FLP-18A dominates the As-PCF peptidome, (iii) As-PCF potently modulates nematode reproductive muscle function , mirroring the effects of synthetic FLP-18 peptides, (iv) As-PCF activates the  FLP-18 receptors NPR-4 and -5, (v) As-PCF alters  behavior, and (vi) FLP-18 and FLP-18 receptors display pan-phylum distribution in nematodes. This study provides the first direct experimental evidence to support an extrasynaptic volume route for neuropeptide transmission in nematodes. These data indicate nonsynaptic signaling within the nematode functional connectome and are particularly pertinent to receptor deorphanization approaches underpinning drug discovery programs for nematode pathogens.',\n",

The corticospinal motor circuitry plays a major role in controlling skilled movements and in planning and coordinating movements in mammals and can be damaged by SCI. While axonal regeneration of injured fibers over long distances is scarce in the adult CNS, substantial spontaneous neural reorganization and plasticity in the spared corticospinal motor circuitry has been shown in experimental SCI models, associated with functional recovery. Beneficially harnessing this neuroplasticity of the corticospinal motor circuitry represents a highly promising therapeutic approach for improving locomotor outcomes after SCI. Several different strategies have been used to date for this purpose including neuromodulation (spinal cord/brain stimulation strategies and brain-machine interfaces), rehabilitative training (targeting activity-dependent plasticity), stem cells and biological scaffolds, neuroregenerative/neuroprotective pharmacotherapies, and light-based therapies like photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photobiomodulation (PMBT). This review provides an overview of the spontaneous reorganization and neuroplasticity in the corticospinal motor circuitry after SCI and summarizes the various therapeutic approaches used to beneficially harness this neuroplasticity for functional recovery after SCI in preclinical animal model and clinical human patients' studies.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Oligodendrocytes generate myelin sheaths vital for the formation, health, and function of the CNS. Myelin sheath length is a key property that determines axonal conduction velocity and is known to be variable across the CNS. Myelin sheath length can be modified by neuronal activity, suggesting that dynamic regulation of sheath length might contribute to the functional plasticity of neural circuits. Although the mechanisms that establish and refine myelin sheath length are important determinants of brain function, our understanding of these remains limited. In recent years, the membranes of myelin sheaths have been increasingly recognized to contain ion channels and transporters that are associated with specific important oligodendrocyte functions, including metabolic support of axons and the regulation of ion homeostasis, but none have been shown to influence sheath architecture. In this study, we determined that hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, typically associated with neuronal and cardiac excitability, regulate myelin sheath length. Using both  and  approaches, we show that oligodendrocytes abundantly express functional, predominantly HCN2 subunit-containing ion channels. These HCN ion channels retain key pharmacological and biophysical features and regulate the resting membrane potential of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Further, reduction of their function via pharmacological blockade or generation of transgenic mice with two independent oligodendrocyte-specific HCN2 knock-out strategies reduced myelin sheath length. We conclude that HCN2 ion channels are key determinants of myelin sheath length in the CNS. Myelin sheath length is a critical determinant of axonal conduction velocity, but the signaling mechanisms responsible for determining sheath length are poorly understood. Here we find that oligodendrocytes express functional hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated 2 (HCN2) ion channels that regulate the length of myelin sheaths formed by oligodendrocytes in myelinating cultures and in the mouse brain and spinal cord. These results suggest that the regulation of HCN2 channel activity is well placed to refine sheath length and conduction along myelinated axons, providing a potential mechanism for alterations in conduction velocity and circuit function in response to axonal signals such as those generated by increased activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Recent advances in neural engineering allowed the development of neuroprostheses which facilitate functionality in people with neurological problems. In this research, a real-time neuromorphic system is proposed to artificially reproduce the theta wave and firing patterns of different neuronal populations in the CA1, a sub-region of the hippocampus. The hippocampal theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) are an important electrophysiological rhythm that contributes in various cognitive functions, including navigation, memory, and novelty detection. The proposed CA1 neuromimetic circuit includes 100 linearized Pinsky-Rinzel neurons and 668 excitatory and inhibitory synapses on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The implemented spiking neural network of the CA1 includes the main neuronal populations for the theta rhythm generation: excitatory pyramidal cells, PV+ basket cells, and Oriens Lacunosum-Moleculare (OLM) cells which are inhibitory interneurons. Moreover, the main inputs to the CA1 region from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant pathway, the CA3 via Schaffer collaterals, and the medial septum via fimbria-fornix are also implemented on the FPGA using a bursting leaky-integrate and fire (LIF) neuron model. The results of hardware realization show that the proposed CA1 neuromimetic circuit successfully reconstructs the theta oscillations and functionally illustrates the phase relations between firing responses of the different neuronal populations. It is also evaluated the impact of medial septum elimination on the firing patterns of the CA1 neuronal population and the theta wave's characteristics. This neuromorphic system can be considered as a potential platform that opens opportunities for neuroprosthetic applications in future works.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), different degrees of degeneration to the nigrostriatal pathway produce distinct profiles of synaptic alterations that depend on progressive changes in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR)-mediated functions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces modifications in glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems, suggesting that it may have an impact on glutamatergic synapses modulated by dopamine neurotransmission. However, no studies have so far explored the mechanisms of rTMS effects at early stages of PD. We tested the hypothesis that in vivo application of rTMS with intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) pattern alleviates corticostriatal dysfunctions by modulating NMDAR-dependent plasticity in a rat model of early parkinsonism. Dorsolateral striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) activity was studied through ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in corticostriatal slices obtained from 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, subjected to a single session (acute) of iTBS and tested for forelimb akinesia with the stepping test. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to analyze morphological correlates of plasticity in SPNs. Acute iTBS ameliorated limb akinesia and rescued corticostriatal long-term potentiation (LTP) in SPNs of partially lesioned rats. This effect was abolished by applying a selective inhibitor of GluN2B-subunit-containing NMDAR, suggesting that iTBS treatment could be associated with an enhanced activation of specific NMDAR subunits, which are major regulators of structural plasticity during synapse development. Morphological analyses of SPNs revealed that iTBS treatment reverted dendritic spine loss inducing a prevalence of thin-elongated spines in the biocytin-filled SPNs. Taken together, our data identify that an acute iTBS treatment produces a series of plastic changes underlying striatal compensatory adaptation in the parkinsonian basal ganglia circuit. © 2021 The Authors.

Although comprehensively studied for over three decades, there are still major questions about the computational steps of this circuit. We used fourth instar larvae of Locusta migratoria to describe the connection between the lobula giant movement detector 1 (LGMD1) neuron in the lobula complex and the upstream neuropil, the medulla. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the connecting neurons termed trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons and their synaptic connectivity. This enabled us to trace neurons over several hundred micrometers between the medulla and the lobula complex while identifying their synapses. We traced two different TmA neurons, each from a different individual, from their synapses with the LGMD in the lobula complex up into the medulla and describe their synaptic relationships. There is not a simple downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron onto these TmA neurons; there is also a feedback loop in place with TmA neurons making outputs as well as receiving inputs. More than one type of neuron shapes the signal of the TmA neurons in the medulla. We found both columnar and trans-columnar neurons connected with the traced TmA neurons in the medulla. These findings indicate that there are computational steps in the medulla that have not been included in models of the neuronal pathway for looming detection.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Memory and cognitive impairment as sequelae of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and age-related dementia are major health issues with increasing social and economic burden. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a potential treatment to slow or halt progression of the disease state. The selection of stimulation target is critical, and structures that have been targeted for memory and cognitive enhancement include the Papez circuit, structures projecting to the frontal lobe such as the ventral internal capsule, and the cholinergic forebrain. Recent human clinical and animal model results imply that DBS of the nucleus basalis of Meynert can induce a therapeutic modulation of neuronal activity. Benefits include enhanced activity across the cortical mantle, and potential for amelioration of neuropathological mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease. The choice of stimulation parameters is also critical. High-frequency, continuous stimulation is used for movement disorders as a way of inhibiting their output; however, no overexcitation has been hypothesized in Alzheimer's disease and lower stimulation frequency or intermittent patterns of stimulation (periods of stimulation interleaved with periods of no stimulation) are likely to be more effective for stimulation of the cholinergic forebrain. Efficacy and long-term tolerance in human patients remain open questions, though the cumulative experience gained by DBS for movement disorders provides assurance for the safety of the procedure.\",\n",

For the cortex to optimize perception, its neuronal network needs to dynamically retrieve and encode new information. Over the last few decades, research has started to provide insight into how the cortex serves these functions. Building on classical Hebbian plasticity models, the latest hypotheses hold that throughout experience and learning, streams of feedforward, feedback, and modulatory information operate in selective and coordinated manners to alter the strength of synapses and ultimately change the response properties of cortical neurons. Here, we describe cortical plasticity mechanisms that involve the concerted action of feedforward and long-range feedback input onto pyramidal neurons as well as the implication of local disinhibitory circuit motifs in this process.',\n",

However, because of its deep location in the brain, the CA3 area has been difficult to target with modern calcium imaging approaches. Here, we achieved chronic two-photon calcium imaging of CA3 pyramidal neurons with the red fluorescent calcium indicator R-CaMP1.07 in anesthetized and awake mice. We characterize CA3 neuronal activity at both the single-cell and population level and assess its stability across multiple imaging days. During both anesthesia and wakefulness, nearly all CA3 pyramidal neurons displayed calcium transients. Most of the calcium transients were consistent with a high incidence of bursts of action potentials (APs), based on calibration measurements using simultaneous juxtacellular recordings and calcium imaging. In awake mice, we found state-dependent differences with striking large and prolonged calcium transients during locomotion. We estimate that trains of >30 APs over 3 s underlie these salient events. Their abundance in particular subsets of neurons was relatively stable across days. At the population level, we found that co-activity within the CA3 network was above chance level and that co-active neuron pairs maintained their correlated activity over days. Our results corroborate the notion of state-dependent spatiotemporal activity patterns in the recurrent network of CA3 and demonstrate that at least some features of population activity, namely co-activity of cell pairs and likelihood to engage in prolonged high activity, are maintained over days.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuroscience research into how complex brain functions are implemented at an extra-cellular level requires  neural recording interfaces, including microelectrodes and read-out circuitry, with increased observability and spatial resolution. The trend in neural recording interfaces toward employing high-channel-count probes or 2D microelectrodes arrays with densely spaced recording sites for recording large neuronal populations makes it harder to save on resources. The low-noise, low-power requirement specifications of the analog front-end usually requires large silicon occupation, making the problem even more challenging. One common approach to alleviating this consumption area burden relies on time-division multiplexing techniques in which read-out electronics are shared, either partially or totally, between channels while preserving the spatial and temporal resolution of the recordings. In this approach, shared elements have to operate over a shorter time slot per channel and active area is thus traded off against larger operating frequencies and signal bandwidths. As a result, power consumption is only mildly affected, although other performance metrics such as in-band noise or crosstalk may be degraded, particularly if the whole read-out circuit is multiplexed at the analog front-end input. In this article, we review the different implementation alternatives reported for time-division multiplexing neural recording systems, analyze their advantages and drawbacks, and suggest strategies for improving performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is uncertainty regarding when and which groups of neurons fire synchronously during seizures. While several studies found heterogeneous firing during seizures, others suggested synchronous neuronal firing in the seizure core. We tested whether neuronal activity during seizures is orderly in the direction of the excitatory neuronal connections in the circuit. There are strong excitatory connections laterally within the septotemporally organized lamella and inhibitory trans-lamellar connections in the hippocampus, which allow testing of the connectivity hypothesis. We further tested whether epileptogenesis enhances synchrony and antiseizure drug administration disrupts it. We recorded local field potentials from CA1 pyramidal neurons using a small microelectrode array and kindled rats by a rapid, recurrent hippocampal stimulation protocol. We compared cross-correlation, theta phase synchronization, entropy, and event synchronization. These analyses revealed that the firing pattern was correlated along the lamellar, but not the septotemporal, axis during evoked seizures. During kindling, neuronal synchrony increased along the lamellar axis, while synchrony along the septotemporal axis remained relatively low. Additionally, the theta phase distribution demonstrated that CA1 pyramidal cell firing became preferential for theta oscillation negative peak as kindling progressed in the lamellar direction but not in the trans-lamellar direction. Last, event synchronization demonstrated that neuronal firings along the lamellar axis were more synchronized than those along the septotemporal axis. There was a marked decrease in synchronization and phase preference after treatment with phenytoin and levetiracetam. The synchrony structure of CA1 pyramidal neurons during seizures and epileptogenesis depends on anatomic connectivity and plasticity. We could improve the efficacy of brain stimulation to treat seizures by understanding the structure of synchrony. Electrical stimulation may disrupt seizures by desynchronizing neurons, but there is an uncertainty on which groups of neurons fire synchronously or chaotically during seizures. Here, we demonstrate that neurons linked by excitatory connections fire synchronously during seizures, and this synchrony is modulated by epileptogenesis and antiseizure drugs. Closed-loop brain stimulation carefully targeted to disrupt synchrony may improve the treatment of seizures.',\n",

Electrical stimulation of the lateral preoptic area (LPA) at the level of the decussation of the anterior commissure in cats evokes relaxation of the bladder, whereas ventral stimulation of LPA evokes vigorous contraction. Endogenous Angiotensin-(1-7) [(Ang-(1-7)] synthesis depends on ACE-2, and its actions on binding to Mas receptors, which were found in LPA neurons. We aimed to investigate the Ang-(1-7) actions into the LPA on intravesical pressure (IP) and cardiovascular parameters. The gene and protein expressions of Mas receptors and ACE-2 were also evaluated in the LPA. Angiotensin-(1-7) (5 nmol/μL) or A-779 (Mas receptor antagonist, 50 nmol/μL) was injected into the LPA in anesthetized female Wistar rats; and the IP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal conductance (RC) were recorded for 30 min. Unilateral injection of Ang-(1-7) into the LPA increased IP (187.46 ± 37.23%) with peak response at ∼23-25-min post-injection and yielded no changes in MAP, HR, and RC. Unilateral or bilateral injections of A-779 into the LPA decreased IP (-15.88 ± 2.76 and -27.30 ± 3.40%, respectively) and elicited no changes in MAP, HR, and RC. The genes and the protein expression of Mas receptors and ACE-2 were found in the LPA.

       "  'abstract': 'Peptide neuromodulation has been implicated to shield neuronal activity from acute temperature changes that can otherwise lead to loss of motor control or failure of vital behaviors. However, the cellular actions neuropeptides elicit to support temperature-robust activity remain unknown. Here, we find that peptide neuromodulation restores rhythmic bursting in temperature-compromised central pattern generator (CPG) neurons by counteracting membrane shunt and increasing dendritic electrical spread. We show that acutely rising temperatures reduced spike generation and interrupted ongoing rhythmic motor activity in the crustacean gastric mill CPG. Neuronal release and extrinsic application of  tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia), a substance-P-related peptide, restored rhythmic activity. Warming led to a significant decrease in membrane resistance and a shunting of the dendritic signals in the main gastric mill CPG neuron. Using a combination of fluorescent calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we observed that postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated less far within the dendritic neuropil as the system warmed. In the presence of CabTRP Ia, membrane shunt decreased and both postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated farther. At elevated temperatures, CabTRP Ia restored dendritic electrical spread or extended it beyond that at cold temperatures. Selective introduction of the CabTRP Ia conductance using a dynamic clamp demonstrated that the CabTRP Ia voltage-dependent conductance was sufficient to restore rhythmic bursting. Our findings demonstrate that a substance-P-related neuropeptide can boost dendritic electrical spread to maintain neuronal activity when perturbed and reveals key neurophysiological components of neuropeptide actions that support pattern generation in temperature-compromised conditions. Changes in body temperature can have detrimental consequences for the well-being of an organism. Temperature-dependent changes in neuronal activity can be especially dangerous if they affect vital behaviors. Understanding how temperature changes disrupt neuronal activity and identifying how to ameliorate such effects is critically important. Our study of a crustacean circuit shows that warming disrupts rhythmic neuronal activity by increasing membrane shunt and reducing dendritic electrical spread in a key circuit neuron. Through the ionic conductance activated by it, substance-P-related peptide modulation restored electrical spread and counteracted the detrimental temperature effects on rhythmic activity. Because neuropeptides are commonly implicated in sustaining neuronal activity during perturbation, our results provide a promising mechanism to support temperature-robust activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sensorimotor transformation, a process that converts sensory stimuli into motor actions, is critical for the brain to initiate behaviors. Although the circuitry involved in sensorimotor transformation has been well delineated, the molecular logic behind this process remains poorly understood. Here, we performed high-throughput and circuit-specific single-cell transcriptomic analyses of neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure implicated in early sensorimotor transformation. We found that SC neurons in distinct laminae expressed discrete marker genes. Of particular interest,  and  were key markers that define glutamatergic projection neurons in the optic nerve (Op) and intermediate gray (InG) layers, respectively. The Cbln2+ neurons responded to visual stimuli mimicking cruising predators, while the Pitx2+ neurons encoded prey-derived vibrissal tactile cues. By forming distinct input and output connections with other brain areas, these neuronal subtypes independently mediated behaviors of predator avoidance and prey capture. Our results reveal that, in the midbrain, sensorimotor transformation for different behaviors may be performed by separate circuit modules that are molecularly defined by distinct transcriptomic codes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Psychoactive drugs can transiently perturb brain physiology while preserving brain structure. The role of physiological state in shaping neural function can therefore be investigated through neuroimaging of pharmacologically induced effects. Previously, using pharmacological neuroimaging, we found that neural and experiential effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are attributable to agonism of the serotonin-2A receptor (Preller et al., 2018). Here, we integrate brain-wide transcriptomics with biophysically based circuit modeling to simulate acute neuromodulatory effects of LSD on human cortical large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics. Our model captures the inter-areal topography of LSD-induced changes in cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional connectivity. These findings suggest that serotonin-2A-mediated modulation of pyramidal-neuronal gain is a circuit mechanism through which LSD alters cortical functional topography. Individual-subject model fitting captures patterns of individual neural differences in pharmacological response related to altered states of consciousness. This work establishes a framework for linking molecular-level manipulations to systems-level functional alterations, with implications for precision medicine.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'K1.1 containing potassium channels play crucial roles towards dampening neuronal excitability. Mice lacking K1.1 subunits (Kcna1) display recurrent spontaneous seizures and often exhibit sudden unexpected death. Seizures in Kcna1 mice resemble those in well-characterized models of temporal lobe epilepsy known to involve limbic brain regions and spontaneous seizures result in enhanced cFos expression and neuronal death in the amygdala. Yet, the functional alterations leading to amygdala hyperexcitability have not been identified. In this study, we used Kcna1 mice to examine the contributions of K1.1 subunits to excitability in neuronal subtypes from basolateral (BLA) and central lateral (CeL) amygdala known to exhibit distinct firing patterns. We also analyzed synaptic transmission properties in an amygdala local circuit predicted to be involved in epilepsy-related comorbidities. Our data implicate K1.1 subunits in controlling spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity in BLA pyramidal neurons. In the CeL, K1.1 loss enhances intrinsic excitability and impairs inhibitory synaptic transmission, notably resulting in dysfunction of feed-forward inhibition, a critical mechanism for controlling spike timing. Overall, we find inhibitory control of CeL interneurons is reduced in Kcna1 mice suggesting that basal inhibitory network functioning is less able to prevent recurrent hyperexcitation related to seizures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Learning complex motor skills is an essential process in our daily lives. Moreover, it is an important aspect for the development of therapeutic strategies that refer to rehabilitation processes since motor skills previously acquired can be transferred to similar tasks (motor skill transfer) or recovered without further practice after longer delays (motor skill retention). Different acrobatic exercise training (AE) protocols induce plastic changes in areas involved in motor control and improvement in motor performance. However, the plastic mechanisms involved in the retention of a complex motor skill, essential for motor learning, are not well described. Thus, our objective was to analyze the brain plasticity mechanisms involved in motor skill retention in AE . Motor behavior tests, and the expression of synaptophysin (SYP), synapsin-I (SYS), and early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) in brain areas involved in motor learning were evaluated. Young male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sedentary (SED), AE, and AE with retention period (AER). AE was performed three times a week for 8 weeks, with 5 rounds in the circuit. After a fifteen-day retention interval, the AER animals was again exposed to the acrobatic circuit. Our results revealed motor performance improvement in the AE and AER groups. In the elevated beam test, the AER group presented a lower time and greater distance, suggesting retention period is important for optimizing motor learning consolidation. Moreover, AE promoted significant plastic changes in the expression of proteins in important areas involved in control and motor learning, some of which were maintained in the AER group. In summary, these data contribute to the understanding of neural mechanisms involved in motor learning in an animal model, and can be useful to the construction of therapeutics strategies that optimize motor learning in a rehabilitative context.',\n",

Here we find that Opn7b expressed in HEK cells constitutively activates the G pathway and illumination with blue/green light inactivates G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels. This suggests that light acts as an inverse agonist for Opn7b and can be used as an optogenetic tool to inhibit neuronal networks in the dark and interrupt constitutive inhibition in the light. Consistent with this prediction, illumination of recombinant expressed Opn7b in cortical pyramidal cells results in increased neuronal activity. In awake mice, light stimulation of Opn7b expressed in pyramidal cells of somatosensory cortex reliably induces generalized epileptiform activity within a short (<10\\u2009s) delay after onset of stimulation.

       "  'abstract': \"In response to neuronal activity changes, the adult hippocampal circuits undergo continuous synaptic remodeling, which is essential for information processing, learning, and memory encoding. Glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, actively regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity by coordinating the neuronal activity-induced synaptic changes at the circuit level. Emerging evidence suggests that the crosstalk between neurons and glia in the adult hippocampus is region specific and that the mechanisms controlling this process are critically dependent on secreted factors. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a cytokine of the IL-1 family, is a key factor that modulates such glia-driven neuromodulations in two distinct hippocampal circuits. The activation of IL-33 and its receptor complex is important for maintaining the excitatory synaptic activity in the cornu ammonis 1 subregion and the remodeling of dentate gyrus synapses through activity-dependent astrocyte-synapse and microglia-synapse interactions, respectively. Meanwhile, the dysregulation of this signaling is implicated in multiple neurological disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease. Further investigations of how IL-33/ST2 signaling is regulated in a region-specific manner as well as its diverse functions in glia-synapse communications in the adult hippocampal circuitry will provide insights into the nature of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and homeostasis in health and disease.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein are specific features of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases defined as synucleinopathies. Parkinson's disease progression has been correlated with the formation and extracellular release of α-synuclein aggregates, as well as with their spread from neuron to neuron. Therapeutic interventions in the initial stages of Parkinson's disease require a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which α-synuclein disrupts the physiological synaptic and plastic activity of the basal ganglia. For this reason, we identified two early time points to clarify how the intrastriatal injection of α-synuclein-preformed fibrils in rodents via retrograde transmission induces time-dependent electrophysiological and behavioural alterations. We found that intrastriatal α-synuclein-preformed fibrils perturb the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, while the discharge of putative GABAergic cells of the substantia nigra pars reticulata is unchanged. The α-synuclein-induced dysregulation of nigrostriatal function also impairs, in a time-dependent manner, the two main forms of striatal synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We also observed an increased glutamatergic transmission measured as an augmented frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents. These changes in neuronal function in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum were observed before overt neuronal death occurred. In an additional set of experiments, we were able to rescue α-synuclein-induced alterations of motor function, striatal synaptic plasticity and increased spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents by subchronic treatment with l-DOPA, a precursor of dopamine widely used in the therapy of Parkinson's disease, clearly demonstrating that a dysfunctional dopamine system plays a critical role in the early phases of the disease.\",\n",

Here, we show that in male mice, structural and functional changes in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) caused by peripheral nerve injury require neuron-microglial signaling within the local circuit. Following peripheral nerve injury, microglia in the S1 maintain ramified morphology and normal density but up-regulate the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Using in vivo two-photon imaging and Cx3cr1CreER;Bdnfflox mice, we show that conditional knockout of BDNF from microglia prevents nerve injury-induced synaptic remodeling and pyramidal neuron hyperactivity in the S1, as well as pain hypersensitivity in mice. Importantly, S1-targeted removal of microglial BDNF largely recapitulates the beneficial effects of systemic BDNF depletion on cortical plasticity and allodynia. Together, these findings reveal a pivotal role of cerebral microglial BDNF in somatosensory cortical plasticity and pain hypersensitivity.',\n",

This requires the nervous system to coordinate several motor behaviors and execute them in a temporal and smooth manner. We here describe a neuronal circuit that faithfully generates a defensive motor sequence in zebrafish larvae. The temporally specific defensive motor sequence consists of an initial escape and a subsequent swim behavior and can be initiated by unilateral stimulation of a single Mauthner cell (M-cell). The smooth transition from escape behavior to swim behavior is achieved by activating a neuronal chain circuit, which permits an M-cell to drive descending neurons in bilateral nucleus of medial longitudinal fascicle (nMLF) via activation of an intermediate excitatory circuit formed by interconnected hindbrain cranial relay neurons. The sequential activation of M-cells and neurons in bilateral nMLF via activation of hindbrain cranial relay neurons ensures the smooth execution of escape and swim behaviors in a timely manner. We propose an existence of a serial model that executes a temporal motor sequence involving three different brain regions that initiates the escape behavior and triggers a subsequent swim. This model has general implications regarding the neural control of complex motor sequences.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Impaired memory is a common comorbidity of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and often perceived by patients as more problematic than the seizures themselves. The objective of this study is to understand what the relationship of these behavioral impairments is to the underlying pathophysiology, as there are currently no treatments for these deficits, and it remains unknown what circuits are affected. We recorded single neurons in the medial temporal lobes (MTLs) of 62 patients (37 with refractory TLE) who performed a visual recognition memory task to characterize the relationship between behavior, tuning, and anatomical location of memory selective and visually selective neurons. Subjects with a seizure onset zone (SOZ) in the right but not left MTL demonstrated impaired ability to recollect as indicated by the degree of asymmetry of the receiver operating characteristic curve. Of the 1973 recorded neurons, 159 were memory selective (MS) and 366 were visually selective (VS) category cells. The responses of MS neurons located within right but not left MTL SOZs were impaired during high-confidence retrieval trials, mirroring the behavioral deficit seen both in our task and in standardized neuropsychological tests. In contrast, responses of VS neurons were unimpaired in both left and right MTL SOZs. Our findings show that neuronal dysfunction within SOZs in the MTL was specific to a functional cell type and behavior, whereas other cell types respond normally even within the SOZ. We show behavioral metrics that detect right MTL SOZ-related deficits and identify a neuronal correlate of this impairment. Together, these findings show that single-cell responses can be used to assess the causal effects of local circuit disruption by an SOZ in the MTL, and establish a neural correlate of cognitive impairment due to epilepsy that can be used as a biomarker to assess the efficacy of novel treatments.

In a goal-directed behavior-predatory hunting, we show an excitatory brain circuit from the superior colliculus (SC) to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to enhance appetitive locomotion in mice. This tectonigral pathway transmits locomotion-speed signals to dopamine neurons and triggers dopamine release in the dorsal striatum. Synaptic inactivation of this pathway impairs appetitive locomotion but not defensive locomotion.

       "  'abstract': 'α5 subunit GABA type A receptor (GABAR) preferring negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) are cognitive enhancers with antidepressant-like effects. α5-NAM success in treating mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders with excessive inhibition have led to Phase 2 clinical trials for Down syndrome. Despite in vivo efficacy, no study has examined the effects of continued α5-NAM treatment on inhibitory and excitatory synapse plasticity to identify mechanisms of action. Here we used L-655,708, an imidazobenzodiazepine that acts as a highly selective but weak α5-NAM, to investigate the impact of sustained treatment on hippocampal neuron synapse and dendrite development. We show that 2-day pharmacological reduction of α5-GABAR signaling from DIV12-14, when GABARs contribute to depolarization, delays dendritic spine maturation and the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B/GluN2A developmental shift. In contrast, α5-NAM treatment from DIV19-21, when hyperpolarizing GABAR signaling predominates, enhances surface synaptic GluN2A while decreasing GluN2B. Despite changes in NMDAR subtype surface levels and localization, total levels of key excitatory synapse proteins were largely unchanged, and mEPSCs were unaltered. Importantly, 2-day α5-NAM treatment does not alter the total surface levels or distribution of α5-GABARs, reduce the gephyrin inhibitory synaptic scaffold, or impair phasic or tonic inhibition. Furthermore, α5-NAM inhibition of the GABAR tonic current in mature neurons is maintained after 2-day α5-NAM treatment, suggesting reduced tolerance liability, in contrast to other clinically relevant GABAR-targeting drugs such as benzodiazepines. Together, these results show that α5-GABARs contribute to dendritic spine maturation and excitatory synapse development via a NMDAR dependent mechanism without perturbing overall neuronal excitability.',\n",

Developmental dysregulation of MMP-9 may also lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (ND). Here, we test the hypothesis that chronically elevated MMP-9 activity during early neurodevelopment is responsible for neural circuit hyperconnectivity observed in  tadpoles after early exposure to valproic acid (VPA), a known teratogen associated with ND in humans. In  tadpoles, VPA exposure results in excess local synaptic connectivity, disrupted social behavior and increased seizure susceptibility. We found that overexpressing MMP-9 in the brain copies effects of VPA on synaptic connectivity, and blocking MMP-9 activity pharmacologically or genetically reverses effects of VPA on physiology and behavior. We further show that during normal neurodevelopment MMP-9 levels are tightly regulated by neuronal activity and required for structural plasticity. These studies show a critical role for MMP-9 in both normal and abnormal development.',\n",

However, Kiss1 neurons also send projections to many other brain regions within and outside the hypothalamus. Two different populations of Kiss1 neurons, one in the arcuate nucleus (Kiss1) and another in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and periventricular nucleus (PeN; Kiss1) of the hypothalamus are differentially regulated by ovarian steroids, and are believed to form direct contacts with GnRH neurons as well as other neurons. To investigate the projection fields from Kiss1 and Kiss1 neurons in female mice, we used anterograde projection analysis, and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) to explore their functional input to select target neurons within the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH) hypothalamus, key preautonomic nuclei. Cre-dependent viral (AAV1-DIO-ChR2 mCherry) vectors were injected into the brain to label the two Kiss1 neuronal populations. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) for mCherry and neuropeptides combined with confocal microscopy was used to determine the projection-fields of both Kiss1 neuronal groups. Whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics were used to elucidate the functional input to the PVH and DMH. Our analysis revealed many common but also several clearly separate projection fields between the two different populations of Kiss1 neurons. In addition, optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1 projections to PVH prodynorphin, Vglut2 and DMH CART-expressing neurons, revealed excitatory glutamatergic input from Kiss1 neurons and inhibitory GABAergic input from Kiss1 neurons. Therefore, these steroid-sensitive Kiss1 neuronal groups can differentially control the excitability of target neurons to coordinate autonomic functions with reproduction.',\n",

Patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder display heterogeneous socioemotional and cognitive deficits, particularly in the domain of executive function, that share symptoms with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite the availability of several preclinical models, the developmental brain defects causally linked to behavioral deficits induced by FAE remain poorly understood. Here, we first review the effects of FAE on corticostriatal development and its impact on both corticostriatal pathway function and cognitive abilities. We propose three non-mutually exclusive circuit models of corticostriatal dysfunctions to account for some of the FAE-induced cognitive deficits. One model posits that associative-sensorimotor imbalance causes hyper goal-directed behavior, and a second model implies that alteration of prefrontal-striatal behavioral suppression circuits results in loss of behavioral inhibition. A third model suggests that local striatal circuit deficits affect striatal neuronal ensemble function to impair action selection and performance. Finally, we discuss how preclinical approaches applied to these circuit models could offer potential rescue strategies for executive function deficits in patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Plasticity at corticostriatal synapses is a key substrate for a variety of brain functions - including motor control, learning and reward processing - and is often disrupted in disease conditions. Despite intense research pointing toward a dynamic interplay between glutamate, dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission, their precise circuit and synaptic mechanisms regulating their role in striatal plasticity are still unclear. Here, we analyze the role of serotonergic raphe-striatal innervation in the regulation of DA-dependent corticostriatal plasticity. Mice (males and females, 2-6\\xa0months of age) were housed in standard plexiglass cages at constant temperature (22\\xa0±\\xa01°C) and maintained on a 12/12h light/dark cycle with food and demineralized water ad libitum. In the present study, we used a knock-in mouse line in which the green fluorescent protein reporter gene (GFP) replaced the I Tph2 exon (Tph2 mice), allowing selective expression of GFP in the whole 5-HT system, highlighting both somata and neuritis of serotonergic neurons. Heterozygous, Tph2, mice were intercrossed to obtain experimental cohorts, which included Wild-type (Tph2), Heterozygous (Tph2), and Mutant serotonin-depleted (Tph2) animals. Using male and female mice, carrying on different Tph2 gene dosages, we show that Tph2 gene modulation results in sex-specific corticostriatal abnormalities, encompassing the abnormal amplitude of spontaneous glutamatergic transmission and the loss of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) in Tph2 mice of both sexes, while this form of plasticity is normally expressed in control mice (Tph2). Once LTP is induced, only the Tph2 female mice present a loss of synaptic depotentiation. We showed a relevant role of the interaction between dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in controlling striatal synaptic plasticity. Overall, our data unveil that 5-HT plays a primary role in regulating DA-dependent corticostriatal plasticity in a sex-related manner and propose altered 5-HT levels as a critical determinant of disease-associated plasticity defects.

Both canonical and newly identified neuropeptides have a broad spectrum of physiological activity at the hypothalamic neuronal circuit level located within the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei. Magnocellular neurons express a variety of receptors for neuropeptides and neurotransmitters and therefore receive numerous excitatory and inhibitory inputs from important subcortical neural areas such as limbic and brainstem populations. These unique cells are also densely innervated by axons from other hypothalamic nuclei. The vast majority of neurochemical maps pertain to animal models, mainly the rodent hypothalamus, however accumulating preliminary anatomical structural studies have revealed the presence and distribution of several neuropeptides in the human magnocellular nuclei. This review presents a novel and comprehensive evidence based evaluation of neuropeptide expression in the human SON and PVN. Collectively this review aims to cast a new, medically oriented light on hypothalamic neuroanatomy and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for neuropeptide-related physiology and the nature of possible neuroendocrinal interactions between local regulatory pathways.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The mechanisms and neuronal networks associated with anxiety in Parkinson's disease (PD) are incompletely understood. One of the best tools for investigating both component function and neuronal networks associated with psychiatric symptoms is functional MRI (fMRI). Unlike structural scans, functional scans, whether task-based or resting-state, are more likely to be clinically relevant and sensitive to changes related to treatment. The investigators provide a comprehensive review of and present results for imaging studies of anxiety in PD. A systematic review of the literature on fMRI and anxiety in PD was conducted, and the quality of all included studies was simultaneously assessed. Eighteen studies were included: 15 studies assessed anxiety directly, and three evaluated emotional processing. Imaging methodology and behavioral assessments varied across studies, preventing direct comparison of results in most cases. There was a convergence in findings across methods, implicating involvement of the amygdala, caudate, and putamen in association with anxiety in PD. For both task-based activation and resting-state connectivity, dopamine medication status was associated with differences in activation and behavioral function. Although there is little consensus in the current fMRI literature studying anxiety in PD, these results suggest an overlap between structures classically involved in the brain's fear circuit (particularly the amygdala) and the alterations in the nigro-striatal system (e.g., the caudate and putamen and on-off dopamine findings) related to PD and its dopaminergic treatments. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Memristive devices are novel electronic devices, which resistance can be tuned by an external voltage in a non-volatile way. Due to their analog resistive switching behavior, they are considered to emulate the behavior of synapses in neuronal networks. In this work, we investigate memristive devices based on the field-driven redox process between the p-conducting PrCaMnO (PCMO) and different tunnel barriers, namely, AlO, TaO, and WO. In contrast to the more common filamentary-type switching devices, the resistance range of these area-dependent switching devices can be adapted to the requirements of the surrounding circuit. We investigate the impact of the tunnel barrier layer on the switching performance including area scaling of the current and variability. Best performance with respect to the resistance window and the variability is observed for PCMO with a native AlO tunnel oxide. For all different layer stacks, we demonstrate a spike timing dependent plasticity like behavior of the investigated PCMO cells. Furthermore, we can also tune the resistance in an analog fashion by repeated switching the device with voltage pulses of the same amplitude and polarity. Both measurements resemble the plasticity of biological synapses. We investigate in detail the impact of different pulse heights and pulse lengths on the shape of the stepwise SET and RESET curves. We use these measurements as input for the simulation of training and inference in a multilayer perceptron for pattern recognition, to show the use of PCMO-based ReRAM devices as weights in artificial neural networks which are trained by gradient descent methods. Based on this, we identify certain trends for the impact of the applied voltages and pulse length on the resulting shape of the measured curves and on the learning rate and accuracy of the multilayer perceptron.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric disturbances. There is no known cure for HD, but its progressive nature allows for early therapeutic intervention. Currently, much of the research has focused on the striatum, however, there is evidence suggesting that disruption of thalamocortical circuits could underlie some of the early symptoms of HD. Loss of both cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) and thalamic neurons occurs in HD patients, and cognitive, somatosensory, and attention deficits precede motor abnormalities. However, the role of thalamocortical pathways in HD progression has been understudied. Here, we measured single unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) from electrode arrays implanted in the thalamus and primary motor cortex of 4-5\\xa0month-old male and female Q175 mice. We assessed neuronal activity under baseline conditions as well as during presentation of rewards delivered via actuation of an audible solenoid valve. HD mice showed a significantly delayed licking response to the reward stimulus. At the same time, neuronal activation to the reward was delayed in thalamic neurons, CPNs and fast-spiking cortical interneurons (FSIs) of HD mice. In addition, thalamocortical coherence increased at lower frequencies in HD relative to wildtype mice. Together, these data provide evidence that impaired cortical and thalamic responses to reward stimuli, and impaired thalamocortical coherence, may play an important early role in motor, cognitive, and learning deficits in HD patients.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The brain is organized into anatomically distinct structures consisting of a variety of projection neurons. While such evolutionarily conserved neural circuit organization underlies the innate ability of animals to swiftly adapt to environments, they can cause biased cognition and behavior. Although recent studies have begun to address the causal importance of projection-neuron types as distinct computational units, it remains unclear how projection types are functionally organized in encoding variables during cognitive tasks. This review focuses on the neural computation of decision making in the prefrontal cortex and discusses what decision variables are encoded by single neurons, neuronal populations, and projection type, alongside how specific projection types constrain decision making. We focus particularly on \"over-representations\" of distinct decision variables in the prefrontal cortex that reflect the biological and subjective significance of the variables for the decision makers. We suggest that task-specific over-representation in the prefrontal cortex involves the refinement of the given decision making, while generalized over-representation of fundamental decision variables is associated with suboptimal decision biases, including pathological ones such as those in patients with psychiatric disorders. Such over-representation of the fundamental decision variables in the prefrontal cortex appear to be tightly constrained by afferent and efferent connections that can be optogenetically intervened on. These ideas may provide critical insights into potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders, including addiction and depression.',\n",

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is highly dependent upon the integration of dynamic external stimuli and is instrumental in the formation of new spatial memories. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is therefore uniquely sensitive to the summation of neuronal circuit and neuroimmune environments that comprise the neurogenic niche, and has powerful implications in diseases of aging and neurological disorders. This sensitivity underlies the neurogenic niche alterations commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. This review summarizes Alzheimer's disease associated changes in neuronal network activity, neuroinflammatory processes, and adult neural stem cell fate choice that ultimately result in neurogenic niche dysfunction and impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

       "  'abstract': 'The locus coeruleus (LC), which is located in the brain stem, plays an important role in promoting arousal. However, the neural circuitry underlying this function remains unclear. Using cortical electroencephalography combined with optrode recording, we found that LC noradrenergic (LC) neurons exhibit high activity during wakefulness, while suppressing the activity of these neurons causes a reduction in wakefulness. Viral tracing showed that LC neurons directly project to the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) and that optogenetic activation of the noradrenergic (NAergic) LC-VLPO (NAergic) neural circuit promotes arousal. Optrode recordings in the VLPO revealed two functionally distinct neuronal populations that were stimulated in response to the optogenetic activation of LC neurons. Consistently, we identified two types of VLPO neurons that exhibited different responses to NAergic projections from the LC mediated by discrete adrenergic receptors. Together, our results demonstrate that the NAergic neural circuit is a critical pathway for controlling wakefulness and that a synergistic effect is produced by inhibition of sleep-active neurons in the VLPO through α receptors and activation of wake-active neurons in the VLPO through α and β receptors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes enables fast saltatory conduction. Oligodendrocytes are responsive to neuronal activity, which has been shown to induce changes to myelin sheaths, potentially to optimize conduction and neural circuit function. However, the cellular bases of activity-regulated myelination in\\xa0vivo are unclear, partly due to the difficulty of analyzing individual myelinated axons over time. Activity-regulated myelination occurs in specific neuronal subtypes and can be mediated by synaptic vesicle fusion, but several questions remain: it is unclear whether vesicular fusion occurs stochastically along axons or in discrete hotspots during myelination and whether vesicular fusion regulates myelin targeting, formation, and/or growth. It is also unclear why some neurons, but not others, exhibit activity-regulated myelination. Here, we imaged synaptic vesicle fusion in individual neurons in living zebrafish and documented robust vesicular fusion along axons during myelination. Surprisingly, we found that axonal vesicular fusion increased upon and required myelination. We found that axonal vesicular fusion was enriched in hotspots, namely the heminodal non-myelinated domains into which sheaths grew. Blocking vesicular fusion reduced the stable formation and growth of myelin sheaths, and chemogenetically stimulating neuronal activity promoted sheath growth. Finally, we observed high levels of axonal vesicular fusion only in neuronal subtypes that exhibit activity-regulated myelination. Our results identify a novel \"feedforward\" mechanism whereby the process of myelination promotes the neuronal activity-regulated signal, vesicular fusion that, in turn, consolidates sheath growth along specific axons selected for myelination.',\n",

Current therapeutics have been unsuccessful in slowing disease progression, likely due to complex pathological interactions and dysregulated pathways that are poorly understood. The Ts65Dn trisomic mouse model recapitulates both cognitive and morphological deficits of DS and AD, including BFCN degeneration. We utilized Ts65Dn mice to understand mechanisms underlying BFCN degeneration to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. We performed high-throughput, single population RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to interrogate transcriptomic changes within medial septal nucleus (MSN) BFCNs, using laser capture microdissection to individually isolate ~500 choline acetyltransferase-immunopositive neurons in Ts65Dn and normal disomic (2N) mice at 6 months of age (MO). Ts65Dn mice had unique MSN BFCN transcriptomic profiles at ~6 MO clearly differentiating them from 2N mice. Leveraging Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and KEGG analysis, we linked differentially expressed gene (DEG) changes within MSN BFCNs to several canonical pathways and aberrant physiological functions. The dysregulated transcriptomic profile of trisomic BFCNs provides key information underscoring selective vulnerability within the septohippocampal circuit. We propose both expected and novel therapeutic targets for DS and AD, including specific DEGs within cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and neurotrophin pathways, as well as select targets for repairing oxidative phosphorylation status in neurons. We demonstrate and validate this interrogative quantitative bioinformatic analysis of a key dysregulated neuronal population linking single population transcript changes to an established pathological hallmark associated with cognitive decline for therapeutic development in human DS and AD.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Individual neurons can undergo drastic structural changes, known as neuronal remodeling or structural plasticity. One example of this is in response to hormones, such as during puberty in mammals or metamorphosis in insects. However, in each of these examples, it remains unclear whether the remodeled neuron resumes prior patterns of connectivity, and if so, whether the persistent circuits drive similar behaviors. Here, we utilize a well-characterized neural circuit in the  larva: the moonwalker descending neuron (MDN) circuit. We previously showed that larval MDN induces backward crawling, and synapses onto the Pair1 interneuron to inhibit forward crawling (Carreira-Rosario et al., 2018). MDN is remodeled during metamorphosis and regulates backward walking in the adult fly. We investigated whether Pair1 is remodeled during metamorphosis and functions within the MDN circuit during adulthood. We assayed morphology and molecular markers to demonstrate that Pair1 is remodeled during metamorphosis and persists in the adult fly. MDN-Pair1 connectivity is lost during early pupal stages, when both neurons are severely pruned back, but connectivity is re-established at mid-pupal stages and persist into the adult. In the adult, optogenetic activation of Pair1 resulted in arrest of forward locomotion, similar to what is observed in larvae. Thus, the MDN-Pair1 neurons are an interneuronal circuit - a pair of synaptically connected interneurons - that is re-established during metamorphosis, yet generates similar locomotor behavior at both larval and adult stages.',\n",

How these wave patterns emerge and organize across brain structures, and how network connectivity affects spatiotemporal neural activity remains unclear. Here, we develop a computational model of a two-dimensional thalamocortical network, which gives rise to emergent traveling waves similar to those observed experimentally. We illustrate how spontaneous and evoked oscillatory activity in space and time emerge using a closed-loop thalamocortical architecture, sustaining smooth waves in the cortex and staggered waves in the thalamus. We further show that intracortical and thalamocortical network connectivity, cortical excitation/inhibition balance, and thalamocortical or corticothalamic delay can independently or jointly change the spatiotemporal patterns (radial, planar and rotating waves) and characteristics (speed, direction, and frequency) of cortical and thalamic traveling waves. Computer simulations predict that increased thalamic inhibition induces slower cortical frequencies and that enhanced cortical excitation increases traveling wave speed and frequency. Overall, our results provide insight into the genesis and sustainability of thalamocortical spatiotemporal patterns, showing how simple synaptic alterations cause varied spontaneous and evoked wave patterns. Our model and simulations highlight the need for spatially spread neural recordings to uncover critical circuit mechanisms for brain functions.',\n",

Neurofibromin may regulate metabolism, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we show that neurofibromin regulates metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila via a discrete neuronal circuit. Loss of neurofibromin increases metabolic rate via a Ras GAP-related domain-dependent mechanism, increases feeding homeostatically, and alters lipid stores and turnover kinetics. The increase in metabolic rate is independent of locomotor activity, and maps to a sparse subset of neurons. Stimulating these neurons increases metabolic rate, linking their dynamic activity state to metabolism over short time scales. Our results indicate that neurofibromin regulates metabolic rate via neuronal mechanisms, suggest that cellular and systemic metabolic alterations may represent a pathophysiological mechanism in neurofibromatosis type 1, and provide a platform for investigating the cellular role of neurofibromin in metabolic homeostasis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precise positioning of neurons resulting from cell division and migration during development is critical for normal brain function. Disruption of neuronal migration can cause a myriad of neurological disorders. To investigate the functional consequences of defective neuronal positioning on circuit function, we studied a zebrafish  () loss-of-function mutant  () where the facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons fail to migrate out of their birthplace. A jaw movement assay, which measures the opening of the zebrafish jaw (gape), showed that the frequency of gape events, but not their amplitude, was decreased in  mutants. Consistent with this, a larval feeding assay revealed decreased food intake in  mutants, indicating that the FBM circuit in mutants generates defective functional outputs. We tested various mechanisms that could generate defective functional outputs in mutants. While  is ubiquitously expressed in neural and non-neural tissues, jaw cartilage and muscle developed normally in  mutants, and muscle function also appeared to be unaffected. Although FBM neurons were mispositioned in  mutants, axon pathfinding to jaw muscles was unaffected. Moreover, neuromuscular junctions established by FBM neurons on jaw muscles were similar between wildtype siblings and  mutants. Interestingly, motor axons innervating the interhyoideus jaw muscle were frequently defasciculated in  mutants. Furthermore, GCaMP imaging revealed that mutant FBM neurons were less active than their wildtype counterparts. These data show that aberrant positioning of FBM neurons in  mutants is correlated with subtle defects in fasciculation and neuronal activity, potentially generating defective functional outputs.',\n",

Although no thorough research has been conducted, the changes of brain structure and function caused by \"re-domination\" have been reported. This article is a review of the recent research progress on local structure, functional changes, and circuit reorganization of the cerebral cortex after SCI. Alterations of structure and electrical activity characteristics of brain neurons, features of brain functional reorganization, and regulation of brain functions by reconfigured information flow were also explored. The integration of brain function is the basis for the human body to exercise complex/fine movements and is intricately and widely regulated by information flow.

Yet this is no small feat considering the interconnectedness of neurons and other cell types, both within and across brain regions. In this review, we describe recent advances in mouse molecular genetic engineering that can be used to integrate information on brain activity and structure at regional, cellular, and subcellular levels. The convergence of structural inputs can be mapped throughout the brain in a cell type-specific manner by antero- and retrograde viral systems expressing various fluorescent proteins and genetic switches. Furthermore, neural activity can be manipulated using opto- and chemo-genetic tools to interrogate the functional significance of this input convergence. Monitoring neuronal activity is obtained with precise spatiotemporal resolution using genetically encoded sensors for calcium changes and specific neurotransmitters. Combining these genetically engineered mapping tools is a compelling approach for unraveling the structural and functional brain architecture of complex behaviors and malfunctioned states of neurological disorders.',\n",

Adding new neurons to a specific locus of a neural circuit with functional needs is an efficient way to achieve such an adaptive function. However, it is unknown whether neurogenesis is linked to local functional demands potentially specified by the activity of neuronal circuits. By examining the distribution of neurogenesis and different types of neuronal activity in the dentate gyrus of freely moving adult rats, we find that neurogenesis is positionally associated with active excitatory neurons, some of which show place-cell activity, but is positionally dissociated from a type of interneuron with high-burst tendency.

However, the neurobiological mechanisms, especially the neuronal circuity, underlying paternal care is largely unknown. Using socially monogamous male mandarin voles () with high levels of paternal care, we found that paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) or nucleus accumbens (NAc) oxytocin (OT) neurons are activated during paternal care. Chemogenetic activation/inhibition of the PVN OT projection to VTA promoted/decreased paternal care, respectively. Chemogenetic inhibition of the PVN to VTA OT pathway reduced dopamine (DA) release in the NAc of male mandarin voles during licking and grooming of pups as revealed by  fiber photometry.

Furthermore, chemogenetic activation/inhibition of PVN to NAc OT circuit enhanced/inhibited paternal care. This finding is a first step toward delineating the neuronal circuity underlying paternal care and may have implications for treating abnormalities in paternal care associated with paternal postpartum depression or paternal abuse. Paternal behavior is essential for offspring survival and development in some mammalian species. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying the paternal brain are poorly understood. We show that manipulation of paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) oxytocin (OT) projections as well as VTA to nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA projections promote paternal behaviors.

From a variety of sensory inputs, the BNST acts as a node for signal integration and coordination for information relay to downstream central neuroendocrine and autonomic centers for appropriate homeostatic physiological and behavioral responses. In contrast to the role of the amygdala in fear, the BNST has gained wide interest from work suggesting that it has main roles in mediating sustained responses to diffuse, unpredictable and/or long-duration threats that are typically associated with anxiety-related responses. Further, some BNST subregions are highly sexually dimorphic which appear contributory to the differential stress and social interactive behaviors, including reproductive responses, between males and females. Notably, maladaptive BNST neuroplasticity and function have been implicated in chronic pain, depression, anxiety-related abnormalities, and other psychopathologies including posttraumatic stress disorders. The BNST circuits are predominantly GABAergic-the glutaminergic neurons represent a minor population-but the complexity of the system results from an overlay of diverse neuropeptide coexpression in these neurons. More than a dozen neuropeptides may be differentially coexpressed in BNST neurons, and from variable G protein-coupled receptor signaling, may inhibit or activate downstream circuit activities. The mechanisms and roles of these peptides in modulating intrinsic BNST neurocircuit signaling and BNST long-distance target cell projections are still not well understood. Nevertheless, an understanding of some of the principal players may allow assembly of the circuit interactions.',\n",

In this study we introduce a computational thalamocortical model for the sleep-activated epileptiform spikes observed in RE. The cellular and neuronal circuits of this model incorporate recent experimental observations in RE, and replicate the electrophysiological features of RE. Using this model, we demonstrate that: (1) epileptiform spikes can be triggered and promoted by either a reduced NMDA current or h-type current; and (2) changes in inhibitory transmission in the thalamic reticular nucleus mediates an antagonistic dynamic between epileptiform spikes and spindles. This work provides the first computational model that both recapitulates electrophysiological features and provides a mechanistic explanation for the thalamocortical switch between the pathological and physiological electrophysiological rhythms observed during NREM sleep in this common epileptic encephalopathy.',\n",

Recognized causes amount to 20-50% viral infections. Approximately one third of affected subjects develops moderate and severe subsequent damage. Several neurotropic viruses can directly infect pyramidal neurons and induce neuronal death in cortex and hippocampus. The resulting encephalitic syndromes are frequently associated with cognitive deterioration and dementia, but involve numerous parallel and downstream cellular and molecular events that make the interpretation of direct consequences of sudden pyramidal neuronal loss difficult. This, however, would be pivotal for understanding how neuroinflammatory processes initiate the development of neurodegeneration, and thus for targeted prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Here we utilized adult male NexCreERT2xRosa26-eGFP-DTA (=\\u2009'DTA') mice for the induction of a sterile encephalitis by diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons which also recruits immune cells into gray matter. We report multifaceted aftereffects of this defined process, including the expected pathology of classical hippocampal behaviors, evaluated in Morris water maze, but also of (pre)frontal circuit function, assessed by prepulse inhibition. Importantly, we modelled in encephalitis mice novel translationally relevant sequelae, namely altered social interaction/cognition, accompanied by compromised thermoreaction to social stimuli as convenient readout of parallel autonomic nervous system (dys)function. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging disclosed distinct abnormalities in brain dimensions, including cortical and hippocampal layering, as well as of cerebral blood flow and volume. Fluorescent tracer injection, immunohistochemistry and brain flow cytometry revealed persistent blood-brain-barrier perturbance and chronic brain inflammation. Surprisingly, blood flow cytometry showed no abnormalities in circulating major immune cell subsets and plasma high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as proinflammatory marker remained unchanged. The present experimental work, analyzing multidimensional outcomes of direct pyramidal neuronal loss, will open new avenues for urgently needed encephalitis research.\",\n",

Whereas in AD, Aβ is found to act as a pro-epileptogenic factor even before plaque formation, amyloid pathology has been detected among patients with epilepsy with increased risk of developing AD. Among Aβ aggregated species, soluble oligomers are suggested to be responsible for most of Aβ's toxic effects. Aβ oligomers exert extracellular and intracellular toxicity through different mechanisms, including interaction with membrane receptors and the formation of ion-permeable channels in cellular membranes. These damages, linked to an unbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, often result in neuronal hyperexcitability and neural circuit dysfunction, which in turn increase Aβ deposition and facilitate neurodegeneration, resulting in an Aβ-driven vicious loop.

It is not clear whether there are converging mechanisms underlying these debilitating impairments. We found that many autism and schizophrenia risk genes are expressed in the anterodorsal subdivision (AD) of anterior thalamic nuclei, which has reciprocal connectivity with learning and memory structures. CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown of multiple risk genes selectively in AD thalamus led to memory deficits. While the AD is necessary for contextual memory encoding, the neighboring anteroventral subdivision (AV) regulates memory specificity. These distinct functions of AD and AV are mediated through their projections to retrosplenial cortex, using differential mechanisms. Furthermore, knockdown of autism and schizophrenia risk genes PTCHD1, YWHAG, or HERC1 from AD led to neuronal hyperexcitability, and normalization of hyperexcitability rescued memory deficits in these models.

Although the abnormal neuronal development, impaired synaptic functions and impaired neural circuit functions are suggested to be the causes of psychiatric disorders, the molecular and cellular etiology of schizophrenia remains largely unclear. iPS-related technologies can be powerful for not only understanding the molecular and cellular etiology of schizophrenia but also drug discovery research. In 2011, the first iPS cells derived from patients with schizophrenia harboring a DISC1 mutation were generated. Subsequently, many iPS cells from patients with schizophrenia were established for understanding the molecular and cellular disease phenotypes of the differentiated neuronal cells. For replicating disease phenotypes with iPSC-derived neuronal cells, it is important to develop the differentiation strategies for generating cell-type specific cultures of various types of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Especially, scalable cultures of iPSC-derived neuronal cells are valuable platforms for drug discovery research.

Recent studies have implicated Fmn2 in neurodevelopmental disorders, including sensory processing dysfunction and intellectual disability in humans. Cellular characterization of Fmn2 in primary neuronal cultures has identified its function in the regulation of cell-substrate adhesion and consequently growth cone translocation. However, the role of Fmn2 in the development of neural circuits , and its impact on associated behaviors have not been tested. Using automated analysis of behavior and systematic investigation of the associated circuitry, we uncover the role of Fmn2b in zebrafish neural circuit development. As reported in other vertebrates, the zebrafish ortholog of Fmn2 is also enriched in the developing zebrafish nervous system. We find that Fmn2b is required for the development of an excitatory interneuron pathway, the spiral fiber neuron, which is an essential circuit component in the regulation of the Mauthner cell (M-cell)-mediated acoustic startle response. Consistent with the loss of the spiral fiber neurons tracts, high-speed video recording revealed a reduction in the short latency escape events while responsiveness to the stimuli was unaffected. Taken together, this study provides evidence for a circuit-specific requirement of Fmn2b in eliciting an essential behavior in zebrafish. Our findings underscore the importance of Fmn2 in neural development across vertebrate lineages and highlight zebrafish models in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The avian auditory hindbrain is a longstanding model for studying neural circuit development. Information on gene regulatory network (GRN) components underlying this process, however, is scarce. Recently, the spatiotemporal expression of 12 microRNAs (miRNAs) was investigated in the mammalian auditory hindbrain. As a comparative study, we here investigated the spatiotemporal expression of the orthologous miRNAs during development of the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were expressed both at E13, an immature stage, and P14, a mature stage of the auditory system. In most auditory nuclei, a homogeneous expression pattern was observed at both stages, like the mammalian system. An exception was the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). There, at E13, nine miRNAs showed a differential expression pattern along the cochleotopic axis with high expression at the rostromedial pole. One of them showed a gradient expression whereas eight showed a spatially selective expression at the rostral pole that reflected the different rhombomeric origins of this composite nucleus. The miRNA differential expression persisted in the NM to the mature stage, with the selective expression changed to linear gradients. Bioinformatics analysis predicted mRNA targets that are associated with neuronal developmental processes such as neurite and synapse organization, calcium and ephrin-Eph signaling, and neurotransmission. Overall, this first analysis of miRNAs in the chicken central auditory system reveals shared and strikingly distinct features between chicken and murine orthologues. The embryonic gradient expression of these GRN elements in the NM adds miRNA patterns to the list of cochleotopic and developmental gradients in the central auditory system.',\n",

Recent studies on AD mouse models, mimicking this age-dependent amyloidopathy, identified alterations in CA1 neuron excitability. However, these models generally also overexpress mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and there is a lack of a clear correlation of neuronal excitability alterations with progressive amyloidopathy. The active development of computational models of AD points out the need of collecting such experimental data to build a reliable disease model exhibiting AD-like disease progression. We therefore used the feature extraction tool of the Human Brain Project (HBP) Brain Simulation Platform to systematically analyze the excitability profile of CA1 pyramidal neuron in the APPPS1 mouse model. We identified specific features of neuron excitability that best correlate either with over-expression of mutated APP and PS1 or increasing Aβ amyloidopathy. Notably, we report strong alterations in membrane time constant and action potential width and weak alterations in firing behavior. Also, using a CA1 pyramidal neuron model, we evidence amyloidopathy-dependent alterations in   . Finally, cluster analysis of these recordings showed that we could reliably assign a trace to its correct group, opening the door to a more refined, less variable analysis of AD-affected neurons.

       "  'abstract': 'The development and stabilization of neuronal circuits are critical to proper brain function. Synapses are the building blocks of neural circuits. Here we examine the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF). We find that perfusion of oxytocin onto acute brain slices significantly increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) of S1BF L2/3 pyramidal neurons at P10 and P14, but reduces it at the later ages of P22 and P28; the transition occurs at around P18. Since oxytocin expression is itself regulated by sensory experience, we also examine whether the effects of oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission correlate with that of sensory experience. We find that, indeed, the effects of sensory experience and oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission of L2/3 pyramidal neurons both peak at around P14 and plateau around P18, suggesting that they regulate a specific form of synaptic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, with a sensitive/critical period ending around P18. Consistently, oxytocin receptor () expression in glutamatergic neurons of the upper layers of the cerebral cortex peaks around P14. By P28, however,  expression becomes more prominent in GABAergic neurons, especially somatostatin (SST) neurons. At P28, oxytocin perfusion increases inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduces excitatory synaptic transmission, effects that result in a net reduction of neuronal excitation, in contrast to increased excitation at P14. Using oxytocin knockout mice and  conditional knockout mice, we show that loss-of-function of oxytocin affects baseline excitatory synaptic transmission, while  is required for oxytocin-induced changes in excitatory synaptic transmission, at both P14 and P28. Together, these results demonstrate that oxytocin has complex and dynamic functions in regulating synaptic transmission in cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons. These findings add to existing knowledge of the function of oxytocin in regulating neural circuit development and plasticity.',\n",

Using in vivo calcium imaging to longitudinally record sensory-evoked activity under light anesthesia, we did not find any increase in the number of C1 whisker-responsive neurons in the adjacent, spared D3 barrel after stroke. To promote plasticity after stroke, we also plucked all whiskers except C1 (forced use therapy).

       "  'abstract': 'Many persons infected with HIV-1 (PWH) and opioid-dependent individuals experience deficits in sociability that interfere with daily living. Sociability is regulated by the prefrontal cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit. Within this circuit HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (HIV-1 Tat) and opioids can increase dendritic pathology and alter neuronal firing. Changes in sociability are also associated with dysregulation of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as oxytocin or corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the prefrontal cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the interaction of HIV-1 Tat and morphine would impair inter-male social interactions and disrupt oxytocin and CRF within the PFC and associated circuitry. Male mice were exposed to HIV-1 Tat for 8\\xa0weeks and administered saline or escalating doses of morphine twice daily (s.c.) during the last 2\\xa0weeks of HIV-1 Tat exposure. Tat attenuated aggressive interactions with an unknown intruder, whereas morphine decreased both non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions in the resident-intruder test. However, there was no effect of Tat or morphine on non-reciprocal interactions in the social interaction and novelty tests. Tat, but not morphine, decreased oxytocin levels in the PFC and amygdala, whereas both Tat and morphine decreased the percentage of oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In Tat(+) or morphine-exposed mice, regional levels of CRF and oxytocin correlated with alterations in behavior in the social interaction and novelty tests. Overall, decreased expression of oxytocin in the prefrontal cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit is associated with morphine- and HIV-Tat-induced deficits in social behavior.',\n",

Recent experimental studies suggest that cerebellar granule cell (GrC) population activity is low-dimensional. To examine sensorimotor representations from the point of view of downstream Purkinje cell 'decoders', we used three-dimensional acousto-optic lens two-photon microscopy to record from hundreds of GrC axons. Here we show that GrC axon population activity is high dimensional and distributed with little fine-scale spatial structure during spontaneous behaviors. Moreover, distinct behavioral states are represented along orthogonal dimensions in neuronal activity space. These results suggest that the cerebellar cortex supports high-dimensional representations and segregates behavioral state-dependent computations into orthogonal subspaces, as reported in the neocortex.

Sensory perceptions are controlled by specialized neuronal circuits established through fine-tuning, which relies largely on neuronal activity during the development. Spontaneous neuronal activity is an essential driving force of neuronal circuit refinement. At early developmental stages, sensory cortices display spontaneous activities originating from the periphery and characterized by correlated firing arranged spatially according to the modality. The firing patterns are reorganized over time and become sparse, which is typical for the mature brain. This review focuses mainly on rodent sensory cortices. First, the features of the spontaneous activities during early postnatal stages are described. Then, the developmental changes in the spatial organization of the spontaneous activities and the transition mechanisms involved are discussed. The identification of the principles controlling the spatial organization of spontaneous activities in the developing sensory cortex is essential to understand the self-organization process of neuronal circuits.',\n",

Developing mitral cells in the olfactory bulb initially extend multiple primary dendrites. They then stabilize single primary dendrites while eliminating others. However, the mechanisms underlying selective dendrite remodeling remain elusive. Using CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout screening combined with in utero electroporation, we identify BMPR-2 as a key regulator for selective dendrite stabilization. Bmpr2 knockout and its rescue experiments show that BMPR-2 inhibits LIMK without ligands and thereby permits dendrite destabilization. In contrast, the overexpression of antagonists and agonists indicates that ligand-bound BMPR-2 stabilizes dendrites, most likely by releasing LIMK. Using genetic and FRET imaging experiments, we demonstrate that free LIMK is activated by NMDARs via Rac1, facilitating dendrite stabilization through F-actin formation. Thus, the selective stabilization of primary dendrites is ensured by concomitant inputs of BMP ligands and neuronal activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The neural circuits of the central nervous system are the regulatory pathways for feeling, motion control, learning, and memory, and their dysfunction is closely related to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the growing demand for the unraveling of the physiology and functional connectivity of the neural circuits, their fundamental investigation is hampered because of the inability to access the components of neural circuits and the complex microenvironment. As an alternative approach, in vitro human neural circuits show principles of in vivo human neuronal circuit function. They allow access to the cellular compartment and permit real-time monitoring of neural circuits. In this review, we summarize recent advances in reconstituted in vitro neural circuits using engineering techniques. To this end, we provide an overview of the fabrication techniques and methods for stimulation and measurement of in vitro neural circuits. Subsequently, representative examples of in vitro neural circuits are reviewed with a particular focus on the recapitulation of structures and functions observed in vivo, and we summarize their application in the study of various brain diseases. We believe that the in vitro neural circuits can help neuroscience and the neuropharmacology. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the growing demand to unravel the physiology and functional connectivity of the neural circuits, the studies on the in vivo neural circuits are frequently limited due to the poor accessibility. Furthermore, single neuron-based analysis has an inherent limitation in that it does not reflect the full spectrum of the neural circuit physiology. As an alternative approach, in vitro engineered neural circuit models have arisen because they can recapitulate the structural and functional characteristics of in vivo neural circuits. These in vitro neural circuits allow the mimicking of dysregulation of the neural circuits, including neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury. Emerging in vitro engineered neural circuits will provide a better understanding of the (patho-)physiology of neural circuits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Alcohol abuse is a worldwide public health concern and leads to an estimated 90,000 alcohol-related deaths in the United States annually. Alcohol may promote its euphoric and motivational effects, in part, by activating the endogenous opioid system. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) producing neurons located within the arcuate nucleus (ArcN) of the hypothalamus make up one circuit of the endogenous opioid system, and heavily projects to reward-related brain areas such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). POMC producing neurons release β-endorphin and other peptides that target opioid receptors within reward areas to elicit their associated rewarding effects. Here we explore ArcN POMC neuronal activation, as assessed via FosB expression, following alcohol consumption to determine whether activation varied within subsets of ArcN POMC projection neurons targeting different reward-related areas. Fluorescent retrobeads were used to label ArcN POMC projection neurons targeting the NAc, amygdala and VTA in POMC-cre mice expressing the reporter tdTomato. Animals (n\\xa0=\\xa057) were then allowed to voluntarily consume alcohol or water using the drinking-in-the-dark (DID) paradigm, and sacrificed for immunohistochemistry to examine FosB expression within ArcN POMC neurons. Female mice displayed escalation of alcohol intake across DID sessions, whereas males did not. A greater percent of ArcN POMC neurons target the amygdala over the NAc and VTA, and alcohol consumption preferentially activated ArcN POMC neurons targeting the amygdala over other areas. These findings highlight a novel aspect alcohol-induced activation of the endogenous opioid system, whereby alcohol activates a specific subpopulation of ArcN POMC producing neurons that project primarily to the amygdala.

Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) served as a model for inflammatory pain. The CFA injection decreased the thermal thresholds in both sexes but only the male mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior and diminished cognition, while the females were not affected. Increased calcium fluorescence, a marker for neuronal activity, was detected by photometry in the mPFC of males but not in females with CFA. Next, while chemogenetic inhibition of the projections from the mPFC to the LC improved the object recognition memory of males with pain, the inhibition of the mPFC to LC pathway in female mice produced anxiolysis and spatial memory deficits. The behavior results prompted us to compare the reciprocal innervation of mPFC and LC between the sexes. We used an anterograde transsynaptic tagging technique, which relies on postsynaptic cre transfer, to assess the innervation of LC by mPFC efferents. The males showed a higher rate of postsynaptic cre transfer into LC neurons from mPFC efferents than the females. And vice versa, a retrograde tracing experiment demonstrated that LC to mPFC projection neurons were more numerous in females when compared to males. In conclusion, we provide evidence that subtle differences in the reciprocal neuronal circuit between the LC and mPFC may contribute to sex differences associated with the adverse cognitive effects of inflammatory pain.\",\n",

Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Wnt signaling is essential for the integrity of a subset of inhibitory synapses on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We found that inducible expression of the specific Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) in the adult striatum leads to the loss of inhibitory synapses on MSNs and affects the synaptic transmission of D2-MSNs. We also discovered that re-activation of the Wnt pathway by turning off Dkk1 expression after substantial loss of synapses resulted in the complete recovery of GABAergic and dopamine synapse number.

In addition, stress alters dmPFC microglial branching complexity and elevates their terminal process dynamics. In stressed mice, dmPFC microglia contact dendrites more frequently, and dendritic spines with microglial contact are prone to elimination.

The classical Type II cadherins cadherin-8 (Cdh8, CDH8) and cadherin-11 (Cdh11, CDH11) have been implicated as autism risk gene candidates. To explore the role of cadherins in the etiology of autism, we investigated their expression patterns during mouse brain development and in autism-specific human tissue. In mice, expression of cadherin-8 and cadherin-11 was developmentally regulated and enriched in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus/striatum during the peak of dendrite formation and synaptogenesis. Both cadherins were expressed in synaptic compartments but only cadherin-8 associated with the excitatory synaptic marker neuroligin-1. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neural precursor cells (NPCs) and cortical organoids generated from individuals with autism showed upregulated CDH8 expression levels, but downregulated CDH11. We used  knock-out (KO) mice of both sexes to analyze the function of cadherin-11, which could help explain phenotypes observed in autism.   hippocampal neurons exhibited increased dendritic complexity along with altered neuronal and synaptic activity. Similar to the expression profiles in human tissue, levels of cadherin-8 were significantly elevated in  KO brains. Additionally, excitatory synaptic markers neuroligin-1 and postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 were both increased. Together, these results strongly suggest that cadherin-11 is involved in regulating the development of neuronal circuitry and that alterations in the expression levels of cadherin-11 may contribute to the etiology of autism.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Newborns and hatchlings can perform incredibly sophisticated behaviors, but many animals abstain from sexual activity at the beginning of life. Hormonal changes have long been known to drive both physical and behavioral changes during adolescence, leading to the largely untested assumption that sexuality emerges from organizational changes to neuronal circuitry. We show that the transition to sexuality in male  is controlled by hormonal changes, but this regulation is functional rather than structural. In very young males, a broadly acting hormone directly inhibits the activity of three courtship-motivating circuit elements, ensuring the complete suppression of sexual motivation and behavior. Blocking or overriding these inhibitory mechanisms evokes immediate and robust sexual behavior from very young and otherwise asexual males. Similarities to mammalian adolescence suggest a general principle in which hormonal changes gate the transition to sexuality not by constructing new circuitry but by permitting activity in otherwise latent motivational circuit elements.',\n",

A sneeze-evoking region was discovered in both cat and human brainstems, corresponding anatomically to the central recipient zone of nasal sensory neurons. Therefore, we hypothesized that a neuronal population postsynaptic to nasal sensory neurons mediates sneezing in this region. By screening major presynaptic neurotransmitters/neuropeptides released by nasal sensory neurons, we found that neuromedin B (NMB) peptide is essential for signaling sneezing. Ablation of NMB-sensitive postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region or deficiency in NMB receptor abolished the sneezing reflex. Remarkably, NMB-sensitive neurons further project to the caudal ventral respiratory group (cVRG). Chemical activation of NMB-sensitive neurons elicits action potentials in cVRG neurons and leads to sneezing behavior.

       "  'abstract': 'Recent studies in our lab have shown that the K7 channel activator, flupirtine, inhibits colonic epithelial Cl secretion through effects on submucosal neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS). We hypothesized that flupirtine would also stimulate Na absorption as a result of reduced secretory ENS input to the epithelium. To test this hypothesis, unidirectional Na fluxes were measured under voltage-clamped conditions. Pharmacological approaches using an Ussing-style recording chamber combined with immunofluorescence microscopy techniques were used to determine the effect of flupirtine on active Na transport in the rat colon. Flupirtine stimulated electroneutral Na absorption in partially seromuscular-stripped colonic tissues, while simultaneously inhibiting short-circuit current (I; i.e., Cl secretion). Both of these effects were attenuated by pretreatment with the ENS inhibitor, tetrodotoxin. The Na/H exchanger isoform 3 (NHE-3)-selective inhibitor, S3226, significantly inhibited flupirtine-stimulated Na absorption, whereas the NHE-2-selective inhibitor HOE-694 did not. NHE-3 localization near the apical membranes of surface epithelial cells was also more apparent in flupirtine-treated colon versus control. Flupirtine did not alter epithelial Na channel (ENaC)-mediated Na absorption in distal colonic tissues obtained from hyperaldosteronaemic rats and had no effect in the normal ileum but did stimulate Na absorption in the proximal colon. Finally, the parallel effects of flupirtine on I (Cl secretion) and Na absorption were significantly correlated with each other. Together, these data indicate that flupirtine stimulates NHE-3-dependent Na absorption, likely as a result of reduced stimulatory input to the colonic epithelium by submucosal ENS neurons. We present a novel mechanism regarding regulation of epithelial ion transport by enteric neurons. Activation of neuronal K7 K channels markedly stimulates Na absorption and inhibits Cl secretion across the colonic epithelium. This may be useful in developing new treatments for diarrheal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Endocannabinoids are bioactive substances which participate in central motor control. The globus pallidus (GP) is a major nucleus in the basal ganglia circuit, which plays an important function in movement regulation. Both cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CBR) and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CBR) are expressed in the GP suggesting GP as a main action area of endocannabinoids. To investigate the direct electrophysiological and behavioral effects of cannabinoids in GP, in vivo single unit extracellular recordings and behavioral tests were performed in rats. Administration of WIN 55,212-2 exerted three neuronal response patterns from all sampled neurons of GP, including (1) increase of the firing rate; (2) decrease of the firing rate; (3) increase and then decrease of the firing rate. Selectively blocking CBR by AM 251 decreased the firing rate and increased the firing rate. Selectively blocking CBR by AM 630 did not change the firing rate significantly, which suggested that endocannabinoids modulated the spontaneous firing activity of pallidal neurons mainly via CBR. Furthermore, co-application of AM 251, but not AM 630, blocked WIN 55,212-2-induced modulation of firing activity of pallidal neurons. Finally, both haloperidol-induced postural behavioral test and elevated body swing test (EBST) showed that unilateral microinjection of WIN 55,212-2 mainly induced contralateral-biased swing and deflection behaviors. Meanwhile, AM 251 produced opposite effect. The present in vivo study revealed that cannabinoids produced complicated electrophysiological and behavioral effects in the GP, which further demonstrated that the GP is a major functional region of endocannabinoid.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is restricted under the pathological conditions of neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The drop of AHN reduces neural circuit plasticity, resulting in the decrease of the generation of newborn neurons in dentate gyrus (DG), which makes it difficult to recover from learning/memory dysfunction in AD, therefore, it is imperative to find a therapeutic strategy to promote neurogenesis and clarify its underlying mechanism involved. Amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice were treated with photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for 0.1\\u2009mW/mm per day in the dark for 1 month (10\\u2009min for each day). The neural stem cells (NSCs) were isolated from hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice at E14, and the cells were treated with PBMT for 0.667\\u2009mW/mm in the dark (5\\u2009min for each time). In this study, photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is found to promote AHN in APP/PS1 mice. The latent transforming growth factor-β1 (LTGFβ1) was activated in vitro and in vivo during PBMT-induced AHN, which promoted the differentiation of hippocampal APP/PS1 NSCs into newborn neurons. In particular, behavioral experiments showed that PBMT enhanced the spatial learning/memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, PBMT-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) activates TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway to increase the interaction of the transcription factors Smad2/3 with Smad4 and competitively reduce the association of Smad1/5/9 with Smad4, thereby significantly upregulating the expression of doublecortin (Dcx)/neuronal class-III β-tubulin (Tuj1) and downregulating the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These in vitro effects were abrogated when eliminating ROS. Furthermore, specific inhibition of TGFβ receptor I (TGFβR I) attenuates the DNA-binding efficiency of Smad2/3 to the Dcx promotor triggered by PBMT. Our study demonstrates that PBMT, as a viable therapeutic strategy, directs the adult hippocampal APP/PS1 NSCs differentiate towards neurons, which has great potential value for ameliorating the drop of AHN in Alzheimer's disease mice. \",\n",

Mouse models of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM, a rare monogenic form of migraine with aura) show increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression (CSD, the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura and can activate migraine headache mechanisms), allowing an opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of CSD and migraine onset. In FHM type 2 (FHM2) knock-in mice with reduced expression of astrocytic Na, K-ATPases, the reduced rate of glutamate uptake into astrocytes can account for the facilitation of CSD initiation. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms and show that the reduced rate of glutamate clearance in FHM2 mice results in increased amplitude and slowing of rise time and decay of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) elicited in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells by stimulation of neuronal afferents in somatosensory cortex slices. The relative increase in NMDAR activation in FHM2 mice is activity-dependent, being larger after high-frequency compared to low-frequency afferent activity. Inhibition of GluN1-N2B NMDARs, which hardly affected the NMDAR EPSC in wild-type mice, rescued the increased and prolonged activation of NMDARs as well as the facilitation of CSD induction and propagation in FHM2 mice. Our data suggest that the enhanced susceptibility to CSD in FHM2 is mainly due to specific activation of extrasynaptic GluN1-N2B NMDARs and point to these receptors as possible therapeutic targets for prevention of CSD and migraine.',\n",

A variety of efferent-afferent neuronal connections exists within the V1 and between the V1 and higher visual cortical areas or thalamic nuclei, indicating that the V1 system is more than a mere receiver in information processing. Sensory representations in the V1 are dynamically correlated with neural activity oscillations that are distributed across different cortical layers in an input-dependent manner. Circuits consisting of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and inhibitory interneurons (INs) are the basis for generating neural oscillations. In general, INs are clustered with their adjacent PCs to form specific microcircuits that gate or filter the neural information. The interaction between these two cell populations has to be coordinated within a local circuit in order to preserve neural coding schemes and maintain excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance. Phasic alternations of the E-I balance can dynamically regulate temporal rhythms of neural oscillation. Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that the two major sub-types of INs, parvalbumin-expressing (PV) cells and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) INs, are active in controlling slow and fast oscillations, respectively, in the mouse V1. The review summarizes recent experimental findings on elucidating cellular or circuitry mechanisms for the generation of neural oscillations with distinct rhythms in either developing or matured mouse V1, mainly focusing on visual relaying circuits and distinct local inhibitory circuits.',\n",

Increasing evidence indicates that Aβ induces neuronal circuit hyperexcitability in the early stages of AD pathology. As a result, researchers have investigated treatments that modulate the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance as potential AD therapies. For example, levetiracetam, an atypical antiepileptic drug used to quell hyperexcitability, has garnered recent interest in the AD field, even though its exact mechanism(s) of action remains elusive. Here, we show that in APP knock-in mouse models of amyloid pathology, chronic levetiracetam administration decreases cortical Aβ levels and lowers the amyloid plaque burden. In addition, using multiplexed tandem mass tag-quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we determined that chronic levetiracetam administration selectively normalizes levels of presynaptic endocytic proteins. Finally, we found that levetiracetam treatment selectively lowers beta carboxyl-terminal fragment levels, while the abundance of full-length APP remains unchanged. In summary, this work reports that chronic treatment with levetiracetam serves as a useful therapeutic in AD by normalizing levels of presynaptic endocytic proteins and altering APP cleavage preference, leading to a decrease in both Aβ levels and the amyloid plaque burden. These novel findings provide novel evidence for the previously documented therapeutic value of levetiracetam to mitigate AD pathology.\",\n",

After adaptation to huge amounts of simulated data, this method robustly captures the specific feature of monosynaptic impact in a noisy cross-correlogram. There are no user-adjustable parameters. With this new method, we have constructed diagrams of neuronal circuits recorded in several cortical areas of monkeys.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Central pattern generators (CPGs), specialized oscillatory neuronal networks controlling rhythmic motor behaviors such as breathing and locomotion, must adjust their patterns of activity to a variable environment and changing behavioral goals. Neuromodulation adjusts these patterns by orchestrating changes in multiple ionic currents. In the medicinal leech, the endogenous neuromodulator myomodulin speeds up the heartbeat CPG by reducing the electrogenic Na/K pump current and increasing h-current in pairs of mutually inhibitory leech heart interneurons (HNs), which form half-center oscillators (HN HCOs). Here we investigate whether the comodulation of two currents could have advantages over a single current in the control of functional bursting patterns of a CPG. We use a conductance-based biophysical model of an HN HCO to explain the experimental effects of myomodulin. We demonstrate that, in the model, comodulation of the Na/K pump current and h-current expands the range of functional bursting activity by avoiding transitions into nonfunctional regimes, such as asymmetric bursting and plateau-containing seizure-like activity. We validate the model by finding parameters that reproduce temporal bursting characteristics matching experimental recordings from HN HCOs under control, three different myomodulin concentrations, and Cs treated conditions. The matching cases are located along the border of an asymmetric regime away from the border with more dangerous seizure-like activity. We found a simple comodulation mechanism with an inverse relation between the pump and h-currents makes a good fit of the matching cases and comprises a general mechanism for the robust and flexible control of oscillatory neuronal networks. Rhythm-generating neuronal circuits adjust their oscillatory patterns to accommodate a changing environment through neuromodulation. In different species, chemical messengers participating in such processes may target two or more membrane currents. In medicinal leeches, the neuromodulator myomodulin speeds up the heartbeat central pattern generator by reducing Na/K pump current and increasing h-current. In a computational model, we show that this comodulation expands the range of central pattern generator's functional activity by navigating the circuit between dysfunctional regimes resulting in a much wider range of cycle period. This control would not be attainable by modulating only one current, emphasizing the synergy of combined effects. Given the prevalence of h-current and Na/K pump current in neurons, similar comodulation mechanisms may exist across species.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuro-immune interaction during development is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, but the mechanisms that cause neuronal circuit dysregulation are not well understood. We performed  imaging of the developing retinotectal system in the larval zebrafish to characterize the effects of immune system activation on refinement of an archetypal sensory processing circuit. Acute inflammatory insult induced hyper-dynamic remodeling of developing retinal axons in larval fish and increased axon arbor elaboration over days. Using calcium imaging in GCaMP6s transgenic fish we showed that these morphological changes were accompanied by a shift toward decreased visual acuity in tectal cells. This finding was supported by poorer performance in a visually guided behavioral task. We further found that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is upregulated by the inflammatory insult, and that down-regulation of IL-1β abrogated the effects of inflammation on axonal dynamics and growth. Moreover, baseline branching of the RGC arbors in IL-1β morphant animals was significantly different from that in control larvae, and their performance in a predation assay was impaired, indicating a role for this cytokine in normal neuronal development. This work establishes a simple and powerful non-mammalian model of developmental immune activation and demonstrates a role for IL-1β in mediating the pathological effects of inflammation on neuronal circuit development.Maternal immune activation (MIA) can increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, however the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Using a non-mammalian vertebrate model of developmental immune activation, we show that even brief activation of inflammatory pathways has immediate and long-term effects on the arborization of axons, and that these morphological changes have functional and behavioral consequences. Finally, we show that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β plays an essential role in both the effects of inflammation on circuit formation and normal axonal development. Our data add to a growing body of evidence supporting epidemiological studies linking immune activation to neurodevelopmental disorders, and help shed light on the molecular and cellular processes that contribute to the etiology of these disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Xenopus laevis experimental system has provided significant insight into the development and plasticity of neural circuits. Xenopus neuroscience research would be enhanced by additional tools to study neural circuit structure and function. Rabies viruses are powerful tools to label and manipulate neural circuits and have been widely used to study mesoscale connectomics. Whether rabies virus can be used to transduce neurons and express transgenes in Xenopus has not been systematically investigated. Glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus transduces neurons at the axon terminal and retrogradely labels their cell bodies. We show that glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus infects local and projection neurons in the Xenopus tadpole when directly injected into brain tissue. Pseudotyping glycoprotein-deleted rabies with EnvA restricts infection to cells with exogenous expression of the EnvA receptor, TVA. EnvA pseudotyped virus specifically infects tadpole neurons with promoter-driven expression of TVA, demonstrating its utility to label targeted neuronal populations. Neuronal cell types are defined by a combination of features including anatomical location, expression of genetic markers, axon projection sites, morphology, and physiological properties. We show that driving TVA expression in one hemisphere and injecting EnvA pseudotyped virus into the contralateral hemisphere, retrogradely labels neurons defined by cell body location and axon projection site. Using this approach, rabies can be used to identify cell types in Xenopus brain and simultaneously to express transgenes which enable monitoring or manipulation of neuronal activity. This makes rabies a valuable tool to study the structure and function of neural circuits in Xenopus.Studies in Xenopus have contributed a great deal to our understanding of brain circuit development and plasticity, regeneration, and hormonal regulation of behavior and metamorphosis. Here, we show that recombinant rabies virus transduces neurons in the Xenopus tadpole, enlarging the toolbox that can be applied to studying Xenopus brain. Rabies can be used for retrograde labeling and expression of a broad range of transgenes including fluorescent proteins for anatomical tracing and studying neuronal morphology, voltage or calcium indicators to visualize neuronal activity, and photo- or chemosensitive channels to control neuronal activity. The versatility of these tools enables diverse experiments to analyze and manipulate Xenopus brain structure and function, including mesoscale connectivity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Harmful algal blooms produce potent neurotoxins that accumulate in seafood and are hazardous to human health. Developmental exposure to the harmful algal bloom toxin, domoic acid (DomA), has behavioral consequences well into adulthood, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DomA developmental neurotoxicity are largely unknown. To assess these, we exposed zebrafish embryos to DomA during the previously identified window of susceptibility and used the well-known startle response circuit as a tool to identify specific neuronal components that are targeted by exposure to DomA. Exposure to DomA reduced startle responsiveness to both auditory/vibrational and electrical stimuli, and even at the highest stimulus intensities tested, led to a dramatic reduction of one type of startle (short-latency c-starts). Furthermore, DomA-exposed larvae had altered kinematics for both types of startle responses tested, exhibiting shallower bend angles and slower maximal angular velocities. Using vital dye staining, immunolabeling, and live imaging of transgenic lines, we determined that although the sensory inputs were intact, the reticulospinal neurons required for short-latency c-starts were absent in most DomA-exposed larvae. Furthermore, axon tracing revealed that DomA-treated larvae also showed significantly reduced primary motor neuron axon collaterals. Overall, these results show that developmental exposure to DomA targets large reticulospinal neurons and motor neuron axon collaterals, resulting in measurable deficits in startle behavior. They further provide a framework for using the startle response circuit to identify specific neural populations disrupted by toxins or toxicants and to link these disruptions to functional consequences for neural circuit function and behavior.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recurrent circuitry components are distributed widely within the brain, including both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. Recurrent neuronal networks have potential stability problems, perhaps a predisposition to epilepsy. More generally, instability risks making internal representations of information unreliable. To assess the inherent stability properties of such recurrent networks, we tested a linear summation, non-spiking neuron model with and without a \"dynamic leak\", corresponding to the low-pass filtering of synaptic input current by the RC circuit of the biological membrane. We first show that the output of this neuron model, in either of its two forms, follows its input at a higher fidelity than a wide range of spiking neuron models across a range of input frequencies. Then we constructed fully connected recurrent networks with equal numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and randomly distributed weights across all synapses. When the networks were driven by pseudorandom sensory inputs with varying frequency, the recurrent network activity tended to induce high frequency self-amplifying components, sometimes evident as distinct transients, which were not present in the input data. The addition of a dynamic leak based on known membrane properties consistently removed such spurious high frequency noise across all networks. Furthermore, we found that the neuron model with dynamic leak imparts a network stability that seamlessly scales with the size of the network, conduction delays, the input density of the sensory signal and a wide range of synaptic weight distributions. Our findings suggest that neuronal dynamic leak serves the beneficial function of protecting recurrent neuronal circuitry from the self-induction of spurious high frequency signals, thereby permitting the brain to utilize this architectural circuitry component regardless of network size or recurrency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Coracias benghalensis, commonly known as Indian Roller, a subtropical seasonally breeding bird native to Prayagraj (25° 28' N, 81° 54' E), U.P., India, exhibits a specific rolling behavior (an ornate sexual display) to attract the female for courtship. We hypothesized that the emergence of the seasonal rolling behavior of C. benghalensis would coincide with seasonal neuronal morphology changes in the dorsomedial hippocampus (DMH) area of the hippocampal complex (HCC). To test this hypothesis, the present study aimed to reveal qualitative and quantitative changes in neuronal plasticity in various neuronal classes of DMH across the breeding (pre-breeding and breeding) and the non-breeding (quiescent and regression) phases of the reproductive cycle of C. benghalensis. Plasticity in the morphology of four neuronal types (unipolar, bipolar, pyramidal, and multipolar) in the DMH area of HCC during the breeding and the non-breeding phases was characterized by using Golgi-Colonnier staining for identification and characterization of neuronal morphology. As compared to the quiescent phase, a significant increase of soma diameter, dendritic field, dendritic thickness, length of spine neck, spine head diameter, number of visible spines, and spine density in all four types of neurons was observed during the breeding phase. In contrast, significant decreases were observed during the bird's non-breeding phase compared to the breeding phase. This study concludes that during the breeding phase of C. benghalensis, neuronal arborization was substantially increased in DMH, suggesting an enhanced capability for circuit plasticity possibly underlying rolling behavior. Our study establishes seasonal plasticity in DMH and will serve as a novel model for future studies investigating the molecular, physiological, and cellular mechanisms underlying complex, yet stereotyped, sensorimotor behavior.\",\n",

The diverse computational properties of synapses are shaped by the interactions between pre- and postsynaptic neurons. How synapses are assembled to form a neural circuit, and how the specificity of synaptic connections is achieved, is largely unknown. Here, I posit that synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) organize synapse formation. Diverse SAMs collaborate to achieve the astounding specificity and plasticity of synapses, with each SAM contributing different facets. In orchestrating synapse assembly, SAMs likely act as signal transduction devices. Although many candidate SAMs are known, only a few SAMs appear to have a major impact on synapse formation. Thus, a limited set of collaborating SAMs likely suffices to account for synapse formation. Strikingly, several SAMs are genetically linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that impairments in synapse assembly are instrumental in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.',\n",

Rodent studies show that cocaine self-administration (CSA) reduces OFC contribution to goal-directed behavior and behavioral strategies to avoid drug intake. This change in OFC function persists for many weeks after cocaine withdrawal, suggesting involvement in the process of addiction. The mechanisms underlying impaired OFC function by cocaine are not well-understood. However, studies implicate altered OFC serotonin (5-HT) function in disrupted cognitive processes during addiction and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, it is hypothesized that cocaine impairment of OFC function involves changes in 5-HT signaling, and previous work shows that 5-HT and 5-HT receptor-mediated effects on OFC pyramidal neurons (PyNs) are impaired weeks after cocaine withdrawal. However, 5-HT effects on other contributors to OFC circuit function have not been fully investigated, including the parvalbumin-containing, fast-spiking interneurons (OFC), whose function is essential to normal OFC-mediated behavior. Here, 5-HT function in naive rats and those withdrawn from CSA were evaluated using a novel rat transgenic line in which the rat parvalbumin promoter drives Cre-recombinase expression to permit identification of OFC cells by fluorescent reporter protein expression. We find that whereas CSA altered basal synaptic and membrane properties of the OFC neurons in a sex-dependent manner, the effects of 5-HT on these cells were unchanged by CSA. These data suggest that the behavioral effects of dysregulated OFC 5-HT function caused by cocaine experience are primarily mediated by changes in 5-HT signaling at PyNs, and not at OFC neurons.',\n",

HFS in dorsomedial striatum caused increased locomotion behaviors, but not classical stereotypy. However, rats had either an increase or decrease in substantia nigrás evoked potentials.

Calcr+ MPOA neurons activated by parental care project to somatomotor and monoaminergic brainstem nuclei. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing reveals that significant modification of afferents to Calcr+ neurons occurs in mothers. Knockdown of either Calcr or amylin gene expression hampers risk-taking maternal care, and specific silencing of Calcr+ MPOA neurons inhibits nurturing behaviors, while pharmacogenetic activation prevents infanticide in virgin males. These data indicate that Calcr+ MPOA neurons are required for both maternal and allomaternal nurturing behaviors and that upregulation of amylin-Calcr signaling in the MPOA at least partially mediates risk-taking maternal care, possibly via modified connectomics of Calcr+ neurons postpartum.',\n",

Recent advances in nanotechnology, on the other hand, have enabled unprecedented tools and techniques for guiding and directing neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro to construct an in vivo-like neuronal network. Nanotechnology allows control over neural stem cells by means of scaffolds that guide neurons to reform synaptic networks in suitable directions in 3D architecture, surface modification/nanopatterning to decide cell fate and stimulate/record signals from neurons to find out the relationships between neuronal circuit connectivity and their pathophysiological functions. Overall, nanotechnology-mediated methods facilitate precise physiochemical controls essential to develop tools appropriate for applications in neuroscience. This review emphasizes the newest applications of nanotechnology for examining central nervous system (CNS) roles and, therefore, provides an insight into how these technologies can be tested in vitro before being used in preclinical and clinical research and their potential role in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.',\n",

Cannabidiol (CBD) shows potential as an adjunctive antipsychotic therapy; however, potential sex effects in these drug interactions remain unknown. In the present study, we sought to elucidate sex effects of CBD coadministration with the atypical antipsychotic iloperidone (ILO) on the activity of primary cortical neuron cultures derived from the rat methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) model used for the study of SZ. Spontaneous network activity measurements were obtained using a multielectrode array at baseline and following administration of CBD or ILO alone, or combined. At baseline, MAM male neurons displayed increased bursting activity whereas MAM female neurons exhibited no difference in bursting activity compared to sex-matched controls. CBD administered alone showed a rapid but transient increase in neuronal activity in the MAM networks, an effect more pronounced in females. Furthermore, ILO had an additive effect on CBD-induced elevations in activity in the MAM male neurons. In the MAM female neurons, CBD or ILO administration resulted in time-dependent elevations in neuronal activity, but the short-term CBD-induced increases in activity were lost when CBD and ILO were combined. Our findings indicate that CBD induces rapid increases in cortical neuronal activity, with sex-specific drug interactions upon ILO coadministration. This suggests that sex should be a consideration when implementing adjunct therapy for treatment of SZ.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A prolonged developmental timeline for GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-expressing inhibitory neurons (GABAergic interneurons) is an amplified trait in larger, gyrencephalic animals. In several species, the generation, migration, and maturation of interneurons take place over several months, in some cases persisting after birth. The late integration of GABAergic interneurons occurs in a region-specific pattern, especially during the early postnatal period. These changes can contribute to the formation of functional connectivity and plasticity, especially in the cortical regions responsible for higher cognitive tasks. In this review, we discuss GABAergic interneuron development in the late gestational and postnatal forebrain. We propose the protracted development of interneurons at each stage (neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and network integration), as a mechanism for increased complexity and cognitive flexibility in larger, gyrencephalic brains. This developmental feature of interneurons also provides an avenue for environmental influences to shape neural circuit formation.',\n",

Here, we demonstrate that dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3)-dependent plasticity in the ventral pallidum (VP) drives potentiation of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens during relapse to cocaine seeking after abstinence. We show that two distinct VP DRD3 neuronal populations projecting to either the lateral habenula (LHb) or the ventral tegmental area (VTA) display different patterns of activity during drug seeking following abstinence from cocaine self-administration and that selective suppression of elevated activity or DRD3 signaling in the LHb-projecting population reduces drug seeking.

Evidence of interictal breathing deficits in DS suggests that alterations in subcortical projections to brainstem nuclei may exist, which might be driving comorbidities in DS. The aim of this study was to determine whether a subcortical structure, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the extended amygdala, is activated by seizures, exhibits changes in excitability, and expresses any alterations in neurons projecting to a brainstem nucleus associated with respiration, stress response, and homeostasis. Experiments were conducted using F1 mice generated by breeding 129.Scn1a mice with wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify neuronal c- activation in DS mice after observed spontaneous seizures. Whole-cell patch-clamp and current-clamp electrophysiology recordings were conducted to evaluate changes in intrinsic and synaptic excitability in the BNST. Spontaneous seizures in DS mice significantly enhanced neuronal c- expression in the BNST. Further, the BNST had altered AMPA/NMDA postsynaptic receptor composition and showed changes in spontaneous neurotransmission, with greater excitation and decreased inhibition. BNST to parabrachial nucleus (PBN) projection neurons exhibited intrinsic excitability in wild-type mice, while these projection neurons were hypoexcitable in DS mice. The findings suggest that there is altered excitability in neurons of the BNST, including BNST-to-PBN projection neurons, in DS mice. These alterations could potentially be driving comorbid aspects of DS outside of seizures, including respiratory dysfunction and sudden death.',\n",

Here, we employed intersectional genetic manipulations to probe the feeding and glucoregulatory function of distinct sensory neurons. We reconstruct the gut innervation patterns of numerous molecularly defined vagal and spinal afferents and identify their downstream brain targets. Bidirectional chemogenetic manipulations, coupled with behavioral and circuit mapping analysis, demonstrated that gut-innervating, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R)-expressing vagal afferents relay anorexigenic signals to parabrachial nucleus neurons that control meal termination. Moreover, GLP1R vagal afferent activation improves glucose tolerance, and their inhibition elevates blood glucose levels independent of food intake. In contrast, gut-innervating, GPR65-expressing vagal afferent stimulation increases hepatic glucose production and activates parabrachial neurons that control normoglycemia, but they are dispensable for feeding regulation. Thus, distinct gut-innervating sensory neurons differentially control feeding and glucoregulatory neurocircuits and may provide specific targets for metabolic control.',\n",

However, its generalizability to intrinsic spinal networks remains incompletely understood. Previously, Barry et al., 2014 used fMRI to reveal bilateral resting state functional connectivity within sensory-dominant and, separately, motor-dominant regions of the spinal cord. Here, we record spike trains from large populations of spinal interneurons in vivo in rats and demonstrate that spontaneous functional connectivity also links sensory- and motor-dominant regions during unconsciousness. The spatiotemporal patterns of connectivity could not be explained by latent afferent activity or by populations of interconnected neurons spiking randomly. We also document connection latencies compatible with mono- and disynaptic interactions and putative excitatory and inhibitory connections. The observed activity is consistent with the hypothesis that salient, experience-dependent patterns of neural transmission introduced during behavior or by injury/disease are reactivated during unconsciousness. Such a spinal replay mechanism could shape circuit-level connectivity and ultimately behavior.',\n",

We use functional imaging to demonstrate that lateral hypothalamic parvalbumin-positive (LH) glutamatergic neurons respond to acute thermal stimuli and a persistent inflammatory irritant. Moreover, their chemogenetic modulation alters both pain-related behavioral adaptations and the unpleasantness of a noxious stimulus. In two models of persistent pain, optogenetic activation of LH neurons or their ventrolateral periaqueductal gray area (vlPAG) axonal projections attenuates nociception, and neuroanatomical tracing reveals that LH neurons preferentially target glutamatergic over GABAergic neurons in the vlPAG. By contrast, LH projections to the lateral habenula regulate aversion but not nociception. Finally, we find that LH activation evokes additive to synergistic antinociceptive interactions with morphine and restores morphine antinociception following the development of morphine tolerance.

One such agent, Epothilone D, has been used to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) by promoting axonal sprouting at the lesion site after SCI. However, the role of Epothilone D in the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in SCI repair is unknown. In the present study, we mainly explored the effects and mechanisms of Epothilone D on the neuronal differentiation of NSCs and revealed a potential new SCI treatment. In vitro differentiation assays, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the effects of Epothilone D on NSC differentiation. Retrograde tracing using a pseudotyped rabies virus was then used to detect neuronal circuit construction. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was valuable for exploring the target gene involved in the neuronal differentiation stimulated by Epothilone D. In addition, lentivirus-induced overexpression and RNA interference technology were applied to demonstrate the function of the target gene. Last, an Apol8-NSC-linear ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) graft was prepared to treat a mouse model of SCI, and functional and electrophysiological evaluations were performed. We first revealed that Epothilone D promoted the neuronal differentiation of cultured NSCs and facilitated neuronal relay formation in the injured site after SCI. Furthermore, the RNA-Seq results demonstrated that Apol8 was upregulated during Epothilone D-induced neuronal relay formation. Lentivirus-mediated Apol8 overexpression in NSCs (Apol8-NSCs) promoted NSC differentiation toward neurons, and an Apol8 interference assay showed that Apol8 had a role in promoting neuronal differentiation under the induction of Epothilone D. Last, Apol8-NSC transplantation with LOCS promoted the neuronal differentiation of transplanted NSCs in the lesion site as well as synapse formation, thus improving the motor function of mice with complete spinal cord transection. Epothilone D can promote the neuronal differentiation of NSCs by upregulating Apol8, which may provide a promising therapeutic target for SCI repair. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Modulation of neuronal thresholds is ubiquitous in the brain. Phenomena such as figure-ground segmentation, motion detection, stimulus anticipation, and shifts in attention all involve changes in a neuron's threshold based on signals from larger scales than its primary inputs. However, this modulation reduces the accuracy with which neurons can represent their primary inputs, creating a mystery as to why threshold modulation is so widespread in the brain. We find that modulation is less detrimental than other forms of neuronal variability and that its negative effects can be nearly completely eliminated if modulation is applied selectively to sparsely responding neurons in a circuit by inhibitory neurons. We verify these predictions in the retina where we find that inhibitory amacrine cells selectively deliver modulation signals to sparsely responding ganglion cell types. Our findings elucidate the central role that inhibitory neurons play in maximizing information transmission under modulation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Psychological stress affects a wide spectrum of brain functions and poses risks for many mental disorders. However, effective therapeutics to alleviate or revert its deleterious effects are lacking. A recently synthesized psychedelic analog tabernanthalog (TBG) has demonstrated anti-addictive and antidepressant potential. Whether TBG can rescue stress-induced affective, sensory, and cognitive deficits, and how it may achieve such effects by modulating neural circuits, remain unknown. Here we show that in mice exposed to unpredictable mild stress (UMS), administration of a single dose of TBG decreases their anxiety level and rescues deficits in sensory processing as well as in cognitive flexibility. Post-stress TBG treatment promotes the regrowth of excitatory neuron dendritic spines lost during UMS, decreases the baseline neuronal activity, and enhances whisking-modulation of neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex. Moreover, calcium imaging in head-fixed mice performing a whisker-dependent texture discrimination task shows that novel textures elicit responses from a greater proportion of neurons in the somatosensory cortex than do familiar textures. Such differential response is diminished by UMS and is restored by TBG. Together, our study reveals the effects of UMS on cortical neuronal circuit activity patterns and demonstrate that TBG combats the detrimental effects of stress by modulating basal and stimulus-dependent neural activity in cortical networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Clinical and translational studies suggest that prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysregulation is a hallmark feature of several affective disorders. Thus, investigating the mechanisms involved in the regulation of PFC function and synaptic plasticity could aid in developing new medications. In recent years, the mGlu and mGlu subtypes of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors have emerged as exciting potential targets for the treatment of affective disorders, as mGlu antagonists exert antidepressant-like effects across many rodent models. Several recent studies suggest that presynaptic mGlu receptors may contribute to these effects by regulating excitatory transmission at synapses from the thalamus to the PFC. Interestingly, we found that mGlu receptors also inhibit excitatory drive to the PFC but act by inducing long-term depression (LTD) at amygdala-PFC synapses. It remains unclear, however, whether blockade of presynaptic, postsynaptic, or glial mGlu receptors contribute to long-term effects on PFC circuit function and antidepressant-like effects of mGlu antagonists. To address these outstanding questions, we leveraged transgenic Grm3 mice and viral-mediated gene transfer to genetically ablate mGlu receptors from pyramidal cells in the frontal cortex of adult mice of all sexes. Consistent with a role for mGlu in PFC pyramidal cells, mGlu-dependent amygdala-cortical LTD was eliminated following mGlu receptor knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown mice displayed a modest, task-specific anxiolytic phenotype and decreased passive coping behaviors. These studies reveal that postsynaptic mGlu receptors are critical for mGlu-dependent LTD and provide convergent genetic evidence suggesting that modulating cortical mGlu receptors may provide a promising new approach for the treatment of mood disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The use of optogenetics to regulate neuronal activity has revolutionized the study of the neural circuitry underlying a number of complex behaviors in rodents. Advances have been particularly evident in the study of brain circuitry and related behaviors, while advances in the study of spinal circuitry have been less striking because of technical hurdles. We have developed and characterized a wireless and fully implantable optoelectronic device that enables optical manipulation of spinal cord circuitry in mice via a microscale light-emitting diode (µLED) placed in the epidural space (NeuroLux spinal optogenetic device). This protocol describes how to surgically implant the device into the epidural space and then analyze light-induced behavior upon µLED activation. We detail optimized optical parameters for in vivo stimulation and demonstrate typical behavioral effects of optogenetic activation of nociceptive spinal afferents using this device. This fully wireless spinal µLED system provides considerable versatility for behavioral assays compared with optogenetic approaches that require tethering of animals, and superior temporal and spatial resolution when compared with other methods used for circuit manipulation such as chemogenetics. The detailed surgical approach and improved functionality of these spinal optoelectronic devices substantially expand the utility of this approach for the study of spinal circuitry and behaviors related to mechanical and thermal sensation, pruriception and nociception. The surgical implantation procedure takes ~1 h. The time required for the study of behaviors that are modulated by the light-activated circuit is variable and will depend upon the nature of the study.',\n",

Pharmacological approaches have not been very successful in alleviating the consequences of nervous system injury. On the contrary, physical activity and rehabilitation interventions are often beneficial to improve the health conditions in the patients with neuronal injuries. Using touch neuron circuit of , we investigated the role of physical exercise in the improvement of functional restoration after axotomy. We found that a swimming session of 90\\u2009min following the axotomy of posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neuron can improve functional recovery in larval and adult stage animals. In older age, multiple exercise sessions were required to enhance the functional recovery. Genetic analysis of axon regeneration mutants showed that exercise-mediated enhancement of functional recovery depends on the ability of axon to regenerate. Exercise promotes early initiation of regrowth, self-fusion of proximal and distal ends, as well as postregrowth enhancement of function. We further found that the swimming exercise promotes axon regeneration through the activity of cellular energy sensor AAK-2/AMPK in both muscle and neuron. Our study established a paradigm where systemic effects of exercise on functional regeneration could be addressed at the single neuron level.',\n",

Recent data have shown that sensory stimuli elicit activity in ensembles of cortical neurons that recapitulate stereotyped spontaneous activity patterns. Here, we elucidate a possible mechanism by which gating of patterned population cortical activity occurs. In this study, sensory-evoked all-or-none cortical population responses were observed in the mouse auditory cortex in vivo and similar stochastic cortical responses were observed in a colliculo-thalamocortical brain slice preparation. Cortical responses were associated with decreases in auditory thalamic synaptic inhibition and increases in thalamic synchrony. Silencing of corticothalamic neurons in layer 6 (but not layer 5) or the thalamic reticular nucleus linearized the cortical responses, suggesting that layer 6 corticothalamic feedback via the thalamic reticular nucleus was responsible for gating stochastic cortical population responses. These data implicate a corticothalamic-thalamic reticular nucleus circuit that modifies thalamic neuronal synchronization to recruit populations of cortical neurons for sensory representations.',\n",

Despite the corresponding need to understand how such memories can be attenuated, the underlying brain circuits remain unknown. Here, combining viral tracing, neuronal activity mapping, fiber photometry, chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic manipulations in mice, we show that the extinction of remote (30-day-old) fear memories depends on thalamic nucleus reuniens (NRe) inputs to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We found that remote, but not recent (1-day-old), fear extinction activates NRe-to-BLA inputs, which become potentiated upon fear reduction. Furthermore, both monosynaptic NRe-to-BLA and total NRe activity increase shortly before freezing cessation, suggesting that the NRe registers and transmits safety signals to the BLA. Accordingly, pan-NRe and pathway-specific NRe-to-BLA inhibition impairs, whereas their activation facilitates, remote fear extinction.

Although the multisensory interactions derived from this combination of information and that shape auditory function are seen across all sensory modalities, our greatest body of knowledge to date centers on how vision influences audition. In this review, we attempt to capture the state of our understanding at this point in time regarding this topic. Following a general introduction, the review is divided into 5 sections. In the first section, we review the psychophysical evidence in humans regarding vision's influence in audition, making the distinction between vision's ability to enhance versus alter auditory performance and perception. Three examples are then described that serve to highlight vision's ability to modulate auditory processes: spatial ventriloquism, cross-modal dynamic capture, and the McGurk effect. The final part of this section discusses models that have been built based on available psychophysical data and that seek to provide greater mechanistic insights into how vision can impact audition. The second section reviews the extant neuroimaging and far-field imaging work on this topic, with a strong emphasis on the roles of feedforward and feedback processes, on imaging insights into the causal nature of audiovisual interactions, and on the limitations of current imaging-based approaches. These limitations point to a greater need for machine-learning-based decoding approaches toward understanding how auditory representations are shaped by vision. The third section reviews the wealth of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological data from animal models that highlights audiovisual interactions at the neuronal and circuit level in both subcortical and cortical structures. It also speaks to the functional significance of audiovisual interactions for two critically important facets of auditory perception-scene analysis and communication. The fourth section presents current evidence for alterations in audiovisual processes in three clinical conditions: autism, schizophrenia, and sensorineural hearing loss. These changes in audiovisual interactions are postulated to have cascading effects on higher-order domains of dysfunction in these conditions. The final section highlights ongoing work seeking to leverage our knowledge of audiovisual interactions to develop better remediation approaches to these sensory-based disorders, founded in concepts of perceptual plasticity in which vision has been shown to have the capacity to facilitate auditory learning.\",\n",

While major progress has been made in understanding the function of individual neurons, circuit interactions remain poorly understood. A fundamental obstacle to deciphering circuit interactions is the limited availability of research tools to observe and manipulate the activity of large, distributed neuronal populations in humans. Here we describe the development, validation, and dissemination of flexible, high-resolution, thin-film (TF) electrodes for recording neural activity in animals and humans.We leveraged standard flexible printed-circuit manufacturing processes to build high-resolution TF electrode arrays. We used biocompatible materials to form the substrate (liquid crystal polymer; LCP), metals (Au, PtIr, and Pd), molding (medical-grade silicone), and 3D-printed housing (nylon). We designed a custom, miniaturized, digitizing headstage to reduce the number of cables required to connect to the acquisition system and reduce the distance between the electrodes and the amplifiers. A custom mechanical system enabled the electrodes and headstages to be pre-assembled prior to sterilization, minimizing the setup time required in the operating room. PtIr electrode coatings lowered impedance and enabled stimulation. High-volume, commercial manufacturing enables cost-effective production of LCP-TF electrodes in large quantities.. Our LCP-TF arrays achieve 25× higher electrode density, 20× higher channel count, and 11× reduced stiffness than conventional clinical electrodes. We validated our LCP-TF electrodes in multiple human intraoperative recording sessions and have disseminated this technology to >10 research groups. Using these arrays, we have observed high-frequency neural activity with sub-millimeter resolution.Our LCP-TF electrodes will advance human neuroscience research and improve clinical care by enabling broad access to transformative, high-resolution electrode arrays.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The hippocampal mossy fiber synapse is a key synapse of the trisynaptic circuit. Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) is the most powerful form of plasticity at this synaptic connection. It is widely believed that mossy fiber PTP is an entirely presynaptic phenomenon, implying that PTP induction is input-specific, and requires neither activity of multiple inputs nor stimulation of postsynaptic neurons. To directly test cooperativity and associativity, we made paired recordings between single mossy fiber terminals and postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. By stimulating non-overlapping mossy fiber inputs converging onto single CA3 neurons, we confirm that PTP is input-specific and non-cooperative. Unexpectedly, mossy fiber PTP exhibits anti-associative induction properties. EPSCs show only minimal PTP after combined pre- and postsynaptic high-frequency stimulation with intact postsynaptic Ca signaling, but marked PTP in the absence of postsynaptic spiking and after suppression of postsynaptic Ca signaling (10\\u2009mM EGTA). PTP is largely recovered by inhibitors of voltage-gated R- and L-type Ca channels, group II mGluRs, and vacuolar-type H-ATPase, suggesting the involvement of retrograde vesicular glutamate signaling. Transsynaptic regulation of PTP extends the repertoire of synaptic computations, implementing a brake on mossy fiber detonation and a \"smart teacher\" function of hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.',\n",

This is due to the large load required for information processing; spiking demands from neurons are high but are a key component to understanding brain functioning. Astrocytic brain cells contribute to the healthy functioning of brain circuits by mediating neuronal network energy and facilitating the formation and stabilization of synaptic connectivity. During development, spontaneous activity influences synaptic formation, shaping brain circuit construction, and adverse astrocyte mutations can lead to pathological processes impacting cognitive impairment due to inefficiencies in network spiking activity. We have developed a measure that quantifies information stability within in vitro networks consisting of mixed neural-astrocyte cells. Brain cells were harvested from mice with mutations to a gene associated with the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, APOE. We calculate energy states of the networks and using these states, we present an entropy-based measure to assess changes in information stability over time. We show that during development, stability profiles of spontaneous network activity are modified by exogenous astrocytes and that network stability, in terms of the rate of change of entropy, is allele dependent.\",\n",

All these processes target neuron intrinsic properties and connectivity to achieve specific physiological goals, raising the question of how they can operate without interfering with each other. Here, we highlight the central importance of a timescale separation in the activation of sodium and T-type calcium channels to sustain robust switches in brain states in thalamic neurons that are compatible with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. We quantify the role of this timescale separation by comparing the robustness of rhythms of six published conductance-based models at the cellular, circuit and network levels.

       "  'abstract': 'Heterogeneities in biological neural circuits manifest in afferent connectivity as well as in local-circuit components such as neuronal excitability, neural structure and local synaptic strengths. The expression of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) amplifies local-circuit heterogeneities and guides heterogeneities in afferent connectivity. How do neurons and their networks endowed with these distinct forms of heterogeneities respond to perturbations to individual ion channels, which are known to change under several physiological and pathophysiological conditions? We sequentially traversed the ion channels-neurons-network scales and assessed the impact of eliminating individual ion channels on conductance-based neuronal and network models endowed with disparate local-circuit and afferent heterogeneities. We found that many ion channels differentially contributed to specific neuronal or network measurements, and the elimination of any given ion channel altered several functional measurements. We then quantified the impact of ion-channel elimination on response decorrelation, a well-established metric to assess the ability of neurons in a network to convey complementary information, in DG networks endowed with different forms of heterogeneities. Notably, we found that networks constructed with structurally immature neurons exhibited functional robustness, manifesting as minimal changes in response decorrelation in the face of ion-channel elimination. Importantly, the average change in output correlation was dependent on the eliminated ion channel but invariant to input correlation. Our analyses suggest that neurogenesis-driven structural heterogeneities could assist the DG network in providing functional resilience to molecular perturbations.',\n",

The generic term LTD encompasses various induction pathways, including activation of NMDA, mGlu or P2X receptors. However, the associated specific molecular mechanisms and effects on synaptic physiology are still unclear. We here compare how NMDAR- or P2XR-dependent LTD affect synaptic nanoscale organization and function in rodents. While both LTDs are associated with a loss and reorganization of synaptic AMPARs, only NMDAR-dependent LTD induction triggers a profound reorganization of PSD-95. This modification, which requires the autophagy machinery to remove the T19-phosphorylated form of PSD-95 from synapses, leads to an increase in AMPAR surface mobility. We demonstrate that these post-synaptic changes that occur specifically during NMDAR-dependent LTD result in an increased short-term plasticity improving neuronal responsiveness of depressed synapses. Our results establish that P2XR- and NMDAR-mediated LTD are associated to functionally distinct forms of LTD.',\n",

However, models that rely solely on pre- and postsynaptic activity for synaptic changes have, so far, not been able to account for learning complex tasks that demand credit assignment in hierarchical networks. Here we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then pyramidal neurons higher in a hierarchical circuit can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures.

The electrophysiological disruption in this circuit, however, remains to be characterized. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the neuronal synchronization in OCD patients. We predicted aberrant oscillatory activity in frontal regions compared to healthy control subjects, which would be alleviated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We compared scalp EEG recordings from nine patients with OCD treated with NAc-DBS with recordings from healthy controls, matched for age and gender. Within the patient group, EEG activity was compared with DBS turned off vs. stimulation at typical clinical settings (3.5\\xa0V, frequency of stimulation 130\\xa0Hz, pulse width 60\\xa0μs). In addition, intracranial EEG was recorded directly from depth macroelectrodes in the NAc in four OCD patients. Cross-frequency coupling between the phase of alpha/low beta oscillations and amplitude of high gamma was significantly increased over midline frontal and parietal electrodes in patients when stimulation was turned off, compared to controls. Critically, in patients, beta (16-25\\xa0Hz) -gamma (110-166\\xa0Hz) phase amplitude coupling source localized to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and was reduced when NAc-DBS was active. In contrast, intracranial EEG recordings showed no beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling. The contribution of non-sinusoidal beta waveforms to this coupling are reported. We reveal an increased beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling in fronto-central scalp sensors in patients suffering from OCD, compared to healthy controls, which may derive from ventromedial prefrontal regions implicated in OCD and is normalized by DBS of the nucleus accumbens. This aberrant cross-frequency coupling could represent a biomarker of OCD, as well as a target for novel therapeutic approaches. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Autonomic nerves, sympathetic and parasympathetic, innervate organs and modulate their functions. It has become evident that afferent and efferent signals of the autonomic nervous system play important roles in regulating systemic metabolism, thereby maintaining homeostasis at the whole-body level. Vagal afferent nerves receive signals, such as nutrients and hormones, from the peripheral organs/tissues including the gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissue then transmit these signals to the hypothalamus, thereby regulating feeding behavior. In addition to roles in controlling appetite, areas in the hypothalamus serve as regulatory centers of both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent fibers. These efferent innervations regulate the functions of peripheral organs/tissues, such as pancreatic islets, adipose tissues and the liver, which play roles in metabolic regulation. Furthermore, recent evidence has unraveled the metabolic regulatory systems governed by autonomic nerve circuits. In these systems, afferent nerves transmit metabolic information from peripheral organs to the central nervous system (CNS) and the CNS thereby regulates the organ functions through the efferent fibers of autonomic nerves. Thus, the autonomic nervous system regulates the homeostasis of systemic metabolism, and both afferent and efferent fibers play critical roles in its regulation. In addition, several lines of evidence demonstrate the roles of the autonomic nervous system in regulating and dysregulating the immune system. This review introduces variety of neuron-mediated inter-organ cross-talk systems and organizes the current knowledge of autonomic control/coordination of systemic metabolism, focusing especially on a liver-brain-pancreatic β-cell autonomic nerve circuit, as well as highlighting the potential importance of connections with the neuronal and immune systems.',\n",

One of the most interesting application of HF-rTMS is the modulation of plasticity in primary motor cortex (M1) to promote recovery after brain injuries. However, the underlying mechanism by which HF-rTMS modulates motor cortex plasticity remain to be investigated. In this study, we investigated the effects of HF-rTMS treatment on morphological plasticity of pyramidal neurons in layer II/III (L2/3) of the primary motor cortex in mice. Our results show that the treatment did not increase anxiety in mice in the open field test and the elevated plus-maze test. Treated mice displayed increased total spine density in apical and basal dendrites, with a predominance of thin spines. The treatment also increased dendritic complexity, as assessed by Sholl analysis at both apical and basal dendrites. Collectively, the results show that HF-rTMS induced remarkable changes in dendritic complexity in primary motor cortex L2/3 connections which may strengthen corticocortical connections increasing integration of information across cortical areas.

       "  'abstract': 'Hearing depends on the transduction of sounds into neural signals by the inner hair cells of the cochlea. Cochleae also have outer hair cells with unique electromotile properties that increase auditory sensitivity, but they are particularly susceptible to damage by intense noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, and aging. Although the outer hair cells have synapses on afferent neurons that project to the brain, the function of this neuronal circuit is unclear. Here, we created a novel mouse allele that inserts a fluorescent reporter at the C1ql1 locus which revealed gene expression in the outer hair cells and allowed creation of outer hair cell-specific C1ql1 knockout mice. We found that C1ql1 expression in outer hair cells corresponds to areas with the most sensitive frequencies of the mouse audiogram, and that it has an unexpected adolescence-onset developmental timing. No expression was observed in the inner hair cells. Since C1QL1 in the brain is made by neurons, transported anterogradely in axons, and functions in the synaptic cleft, C1QL1 may serve a similar function at the outer hair cell afferent synapse. Histological analyses revealed that C1ql1 conditional knockout cochleae may have reduced outer hair cell afferent synapse maintenance. However, auditory behavioral and physiological assays did not reveal a compelling phenotype. Nonetheless, this study identifies a potentially useful gene expressed in the cochlea and opens the door for future studies aimed at elucidating the function of C1QL1 and the function of the outer hair cell and its afferent neurons.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As the tools to simultaneously record electrophysiological signals from large numbers of neurons within and across brain regions become increasingly available, this opens up for the first time the possibility of establishing the details of causal relationships between monosynaptically connected neurons and the patterns of neural activation that underlie perception and behavior. Although recorded activity across synaptically connected neurons has served as the cornerstone for much of what we know about synaptic transmission and plasticity, this has largely been relegated to ex vivo preparations that enable precise targeting under relatively well-controlled conditions. Analogous studies in vivo, where image-guided targeting is often not yet possible, rely on indirect, data-driven measures, and as a result such studies have been sparse and the dependence upon important experimental parameters has not been well studied. Here, using in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings in the topographically aligned rodent thalamocortical pathway, we sought to establish a general experimental and computational framework for inferring synaptic connectivity. Specifically, attacking this problem within a statistical signal detection framework utilizing experimentally recorded data in the ventral-posterior medial (VPm) region of the thalamus and the homologous region in layer 4 of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) revealed a trade-off between network activity levels needed for the data-driven inference and synchronization of nearby neurons within the population that results in masking of synaptic relationships. Here, we provide a framework for establishing connectivity in multisite, multielectrode recordings based on statistical inference, setting the stage for large-scale assessment of synaptic connectivity within and across brain structures. Despite the fact that all brain function relies on the long-range transfer of information across different regions, the tools enabling us to measure connectivity across brain structures are lacking. Here, we provide a statistical framework for identifying and assessing potential monosynaptic connectivity across neuronal circuits from population spiking activity that generalizes to large-scale recording technologies that will help us to better understand the signaling within networks that underlies perception and behavior.',\n",

We find dynamic coding of choice information in SC-projecting M2 neurons during motor planning and execution, and disruption of this information by inhibiting M2 terminals in SC selectively impaired decision maintenance.

       "  'abstract': 'Promoting the combination of robust regeneration of damaged axons and synaptic reconnection of these growing axon populations with appropriate neuronal targets represents a major therapeutic goal following spinal cord injury (SCI). A key impediment to achieving this important aim includes an intrinsic inability of neurons to extend axons in adult CNS, particularly in the context of the chronically-injured spinal cord. We tested whether an inhibitory peptide directed against phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN: a central inhibitor of neuron-intrinsic axon growth potential) could restore inspiratory diaphragm function by reconnecting critical respiratory neural circuitry in a rat model of chronic cervical level 2 (C2) hemisection SCI. We found that systemic delivery of PTEN antagonist peptide 4 (PAP4) starting at 8\\xa0weeks after C2 hemisection promoted substantial, long-distance regeneration of injured bulbospinal rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG) axons into and through the lesion and back toward phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs) located in intact caudal C3-C5 spinal cord. Despite this robust rVRG axon regeneration, PAP4 stimulated only minimal recovery of diaphragm function. Furthermore, re-lesion through the hemisection site completely removed PAP4-induced functional improvement, demonstrating that axon regeneration through the lesion was responsible for this partial functional recovery. Interestingly, there was minimal formation of putative excitatory monosynaptic connections between regrowing rVRG axons and PhMN targets, suggesting that (1) limited rVRG-PhMN synaptic reconnectivity was responsible at least in part for the lack of a significant functional effect, (2) chronically-injured spinal cord presents an obstacle to achieving synaptogenesis between regenerating axons and post-synaptic targets, and (3) addressing this challenge is a potentially-powerful strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy in the chronic SCI setting. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a non-invasive and transient pharmacological approach in chronic SCI to repair the critically-important neural circuitry controlling diaphragmatic respiratory function, but also sheds light on obstacles to circuit plasticity presented by the chronically-injured spinal cord.',\n",

In songbirds, a CBG circuit regulates moment-by-moment variability in song and also enables song plasticity. Studies have shown that variable burst firing in LMAN, the output nucleus of this CBG circuit, actively drives acute song variability, but whether and how LMAN drives long-lasting changes in song remains unclear. Here, we ask whether chronic pharmacological augmentation of LMAN bursting is sufficient to drive plasticity in birds singing stereotyped songs. We show that altered LMAN activity drives cumulative changes in acoustic structure, timing, and sequencing over multiple days, and induces repetitions and silent pauses reminiscent of human stuttering. Changes persisted when LMAN was subsequently inactivated, indicating plasticity in song motor regions. Following cessation of pharmacological treatment, acoustic features and song sequence gradually recovered to their baseline values over a period of days to weeks. Together, our findings show that augmented bursting in CBG circuitry drives plasticity in well-learned motor skills, and may inform treatments for basal ganglia movement disorders.',\n",

To address this, we mapped the developmental origin of 160 interneurons from seven bilateral neural progenitors (neuroblasts) and identify them in a synapse-scale TEM reconstruction of the  larval central nervous system. We find that lineages concurrently build the sensory and motor neuropils by generating sensory and motor hemilineages in a Notch-dependent manner. Neurons in a hemilineage share common synaptic targeting within the neuropil, which is further refined based on neuronal temporal identity. Connectome analysis shows that hemilineage-temporal cohorts share common connectivity. Finally, we show that proximity alone cannot explain the observed connectivity structure, suggesting hemilineage/temporal identity confers an added layer of specificity. Thus, we demonstrate that the mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity also govern circuit formation and function, and that these principles are broadly applicable throughout the nervous system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration in several regions of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. It has become a major health problem, affecting 1% of the world population over 60 years old and 3% of people beyond 80 years. The main histological findings are intracellular Lewy bodies composed of misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, abnormal protein degradation, and synaptic pathobiology have been put forward as mechanisms leading to cell death, α-synuclein deposition, or both. A progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra late in the neurodegeneration leads to developing motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is involved in regulating blood pressure and body fluid balance, also plays other important functions in the brain. The RAS is involved in the autocrine and paracrine regulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic synapses. Dopamine depletion, as in PD, increases angiotensin II expression, which stimulates or inhibits dopamine synthesis and is released via AT1 or AT2 receptors. Furthermore, angiotensin II AT1 receptors inhibit D1 receptor activation allosterically. Therefore, the RAS may have an important modulating role in the flow of information from the brain cortex to the basal ganglia. High angiotensin II levels might even aggravate neurodegeneration, activating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species production.\",\n",

Limited availability of selective genetic and molecular tools has hindered progress in developing a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which mGlu receptors regulate synaptic plasticity and cognition. We examined associative learning in mice with trace fear conditioning, a hippocampal-dependent learning task disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. Underlying cellular mechanisms were assessed using ex\\xa0vivo hippocampal slice preparations with selective pharmacological tools and selective genetic deletion of mGlu receptor expression in specific neuronal subpopulations. mGlu receptor activation enhanced trace fear conditioning and reversed deficits induced by subchronic phencyclidine. Mechanistic studies revealed that mGlu receptor activation induced metaplastic changes, biasing afferent stimulation to induce long-term potentiation through an mGlu receptor-dependent, endocannabinoid-mediated, disinhibitory mechanism. Selective genetic deletion of either mGlu or mGlu from hippocampal pyramidal cells eliminated effects of mGlu activation, revealing a novel mechanism by which mGlu and mGlu interact to enhance cognitive function. These data demonstrate that activation of mGlu receptors in hippocampal pyramidal cells enhances hippocampal-dependent cognition in control and impaired mice by inducing a novel form of metaplasticity to regulate circuit function, providing a clear mechanism through which genetic variation in GRM3 can contribute to cognitive deficits. Developing approaches to positively modulate mGlu receptor function represents an encouraging new avenue for treating cognitive disruption in schizophrenia and other psychiatric diseases. ',\n",

In the past 10\\xa0years, it has become clear that, apart from their role in reproductive physiology, both neuropeptides are also involved in the control of food intake, as well as glucose and energy metabolism. To investigate further the neural mechanisms responsible for these metabolic actions, we assessed the effect of acute i.c.v. administration of Kp or RFRP-3 in ad lib. fed male Wistar rats on feeding behaviour, glucose and energy metabolism, circulating hormones (luteinising hormone, testosterone, insulin and corticosterone) and hypothalamic neuronal activity. Kp increased plasma testosterone levels, had an anorexigenic effect and increased lipid catabolism, as attested by a decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER). RFRP-3 also increased plasma testosterone levels but did not modify food intake or energy metabolism. Both RF-amides increased endogenous glucose production, yet with no change in plasma glucose levels, suggesting that these peptides provoke not only a release of hepatic glucose, but also a change in glucose utilisation. Finally, plasma insulin and corticosterone levels did not change after the RF-amide treatment. The Kp effects were associated with an increased c-Fos expression in the median preoptic area and a reduction in pro-opiomelanocortin immunostaining in the arcuate nucleus. No effects on neuronal activation were found for RFRP-3. Our results provide further evidence that Kp is not only a very potent hypothalamic activator of reproduction, but also part of the hypothalamic circuit controlling energy metabolism.',\n",

Here we investigate in mice how deletion of Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), an inhibitory synapse-specific adhesion protein that has been associated with pathological anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, alters the communication between key brain regions involved in mediating defensive behaviors. To this end, we performed multi-site simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), centromedial amygdala (CeM), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in an open field paradigm. We found that LFP power in the vHPC was profoundly increased and was accompanied by an abnormal modulation of the synchrony of theta frequency oscillations particularly in the vHPC-mPFC-BLA circuit. Moreover, deletion of Nlgn2 increased beta and gamma frequency synchrony across the network, and this increase was associated with increased center avoidance. Local deletion of Nlgn2 in the vHPC and BLA revealed that they encode distinct aspects of this avoidance phenotype, with vHPC linked to immobility and BLA linked to a reduction in exploratory activity. Together, our data demonstrate that alterations in long-range functional connectivity link synaptic inhibition to abnormal defensive behaviors, and that both exaggerated activation of normal defensive circuits and recruitment of fundamentally distinct mechanisms contribute to this phenotype. Nlgn2 knockout mice therefore represent a highly relevant model to study the role of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the circuits underlying anxiety disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Local activity is the capability of a system to amplify infinitesimal fluctuations in energy. Complex phenomena, including the generation of action potentials in neuronal axon membranes, may never emerge in an open system unless some of its constitutive elements operate in a locally active regime. As a result, the recent discovery of solid-state volatile memory devices, which, biased through appropriate DC sources, may enter a local activity domain, and, most importantly, the associated stable yet excitable sub-domain, referred to as edge of chaos, which is where the seed of complexity is actually planted, is of great appeal to the neuromorphic engineering community. This paper applies fundamentals from the theory of local activity to an accurate model of a niobium oxide volatile resistance switching memory to derive the conditions necessary to bias the device in the local activity regime. This allows to partition the entire design parameter space into three domains, where the threshold switch is locally passive (LP), locally active but unstable, and both locally active and stable, respectively. The final part of the article is devoted to point out the extent by which the response of the volatile memristor to quasi-static excitations may differ from its dynamics under DC stress. Reporting experimental measurements, which validate the theoretical predictions, this work clearly demonstrates how invaluable is non-linear system theory for the acquirement of a comprehensive picture of the dynamics of highly non-linear devices, which is an essential prerequisite for a conscious and systematic approach to the design of robust neuromorphic electronics. Given that, as recently proved, the potassium and sodium ion channels in biological axon membranes are locally active memristors, the physical realization of novel artificial neural networks, capable to reproduce the functionalities of the human brain more closely than state-of-the-art purely CMOS hardware architectures, should not leave aside the adoption of resistance switching memories, which, under the appropriate provision of energy, are capable to amplify the small signal, such as the niobium dioxide micro-scale device from NaMLab, chosen as object of theoretical and experimental study in this work.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Making flexible decisions based on prior knowledge about causal environmental structures is a hallmark of goal-directed cognition in mammalian brains. Although several association brain regions, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), have been implicated, the precise neuronal circuit mechanisms underlying knowledge-based decision-making remain elusive. Here, we established an inference-based auditory categorization task where mice performed within-session flexible stimulus re-categorization by inferring the changing task rules. We constructed a reinforcement learning model to recapitulate the inference-based flexible behavior and quantify the hidden variables associated with task structural knowledge. Combining two-photon population imaging and projection-specific optogenetics, we found that auditory cortex (ACx) neurons encoded the hidden task rule variable, which requires feedback input from the OFC. Silencing OFC-ACx input specifically disrupted re-categorization behavior. Direct imaging from OFC axons in the ACx revealed task state-related feedback signals, supporting the knowledge-based updating mechanism. Our data reveal a cortical circuit mechanism underlying structural knowledge-based flexible decision-making.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The basal ganglia network is represented by an interconnected group of subcortical nuclei traditionally thought to play a crucial role in motor learning and movement execution. During the last decades, knowledge about basal ganglia physiology significantly evolved and this network is now considered as a key regulator of important cognitive and emotional processes. Accordingly, the disruption of basal ganglia network dynamics represents a crucial pathogenic factor in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The striatum is the input station of the circuit. Thanks to the synaptic properties of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and their ability to express synaptic plasticity, the striatum exerts a fundamental integrative and filtering role in the basal ganglia network, influencing the functional output of the whole circuit. Although it is currently established that the immune system is able to regulate neuronal transmission and plasticity in specific cortical areas, the role played by immune molecules and immune/glial cells in the modulation of intra-striatal connections and basal ganglia activity still needs to be clarified. In this manuscript, we review the available evidence of immune-based regulation of synaptic activity in the striatum, also discussing how an abnormal immune activation in this region could be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Neuronal activity is established as a driver of oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination. The concept of activity-dependent myelin plasticity, and its role in cognition and disease, is gaining support. Methods capable of resolving changes in the morphology of individual myelinating OL would advance our understanding of myelin plasticity and injury, thus we adapted a labelling approach involving Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) vectors to resolve and quantify the 3-D structure of OL processes and internodes in cerebellar slice cultures. We first demonstrate the utility of the approach by studying changes in OL morphology after complement-mediated injury. SFV vectors injected into cerebellar white matter labelled transitional OL (OL), whose characteristic mixture of myelinating and non-myelinating processes exhibited significant degeneration after complement injury. The method was also capable of resolving finer changes in morphology related to neuronal activity. Prolonged suppression of neuronal activity, which reduced myelination, selectively decreased the length of putative internodes, and the proportion of process branches that supported them, while leaving other features of process morphology unaltered. Overall this work provides novel information on the morphology of OL, and their response to conditions that alter circuit function or induce demyelination.',\n",

In the olfactory system, the two central nodes-the olfactory bulb (OB) and the piriform cortex (PC)-communicate with each other via neural oscillations to shape the olfactory percept. Communication between these nodes have been well characterized in non-human animals but less is known about their role in the human olfactory system. Using a recently developed and validated EEG-based method to extract signals from the OB and PC sources, we show in healthy human participants that there is a bottom-up information flow from the OB to the PC in the beta and gamma frequency bands, while top-down information from the PC to the OB is facilitated by delta and theta oscillations. Importantly, we demonstrate that there was enough information to decipher odor identity above chance from the low gamma in the OB-PC oscillatory circuit as early as 100\\xa0ms after odor onset. These data further our understanding of the critical role of bidirectional information flow in human sensory systems to produce perception.

       "  'abstract': 'Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the occurrence of motor and vocal tics. TS is associated with cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit dysfunction and hyper-excitability of cortical limbic and motor regions that lead to the occurrence of tics. Importantly, individuals with TS often report that their tics are preceded by premonitory sensory/urge phenomena (PU) that are described as uncomfortable bodily sensations that precede the execution of a tic and are experienced as an urge for motor discharge. While tics are most often referred to as involuntary movements, it has been argued by some that tics should be viewed as voluntary movements that are executed in response to the presence of PU. To investigate this issue further, we conducted a study using electroencephalography (EEG). We recorded movement-related EEG (mu- and beta-band oscillations) during (1) the immediate period leading up to the execution of voluntary movements by a group of individuals with TS and a group of matched healthy control participants, and (2) the immediate period leading up to the execution of a tic in a group of individuals with TS. We demonstrate that movement-related mu and beta oscillations are not reliably observed prior to tics in individuals with TS. We interpret this effect as reflecting the greater involvement of a network of brain areas, including the insular and cingulate cortices, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, in the generation of tics in TS. We also show that beta-band desynchronization does occur when individuals with TS initiate voluntary movements, but, in contrast to healthy controls, desynchronization of mu-band oscillations is not observed during the execution of voluntary movements for individuals with TS. We interpret this finding as reflecting a dysfunction of physiological inhibition in TS, thereby contributing to an impaired ability to suppress neuronal populations that may compete with movement preparation processes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Integrated CMOS neural amplifiers are key elements of modern large-scale neuroelectronic interfaces. The neural amplifiers are routinely AC-coupled to electrodes to remove the DC voltage. The large resistances required for the AC coupling circuit are usually realized using MOSFETs that are nonlinear. Specifically, designs with tunable cutoff frequency of the input high‑pass filter may suffer from excessive nonlinearity, since the gate-source voltages of the transistors forming the pseudoresistors vary following the signal being amplified. Consequently, the nonlinear distortion in such circuits may be high for signal frequencies close to the cutoff frequency of the input filter. Here we propose a simple modification of the architecture of a tunable AC-coupled amplifier, in which the bias voltages  of the transistors forming the pseudoresistor are kept constant independently of the signal levels, what results in significantly improved linearity. Based on numerical simulations of the proposed circuit designed in 180 nm technology we analyze the Total Harmonic Distortion levels as a function of signal frequency and amplitude. We also investigate the impact of basic amplifier parameters-gain, cutoff frequency of the AC coupling circuit, and silicon area-on the distortion and noise performance. The post-layout simulations of the complete test ASIC show that the distortion is very significantly reduced at frequencies near the cutoff frequency, when compared to the commonly used circuits. The THD values are below 1.17% for signal frequencies 1 Hz-10 kHz and signal amplitudes up to 10 mV peak-to-peak. The preamplifier area is only 0.0046 mm and the noise is 8.3 µV in the 1 Hz-10 kHz range. To our knowledge this is the first report on a CMOS neural amplifier with systematic characterization of THD across complete range of frequencies and amplitudes of neuronal signals recorded by extracellular electrodes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Disruptions to either sulfate supply or sulfation enzymes can affect brain development and have long-lasting effects on brain function, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing this are incomplete. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are highly sulfated, specialized extracellular matrix structures that regulate the maturation of synaptic connections and neuronal plasticity. We have previously shown that mice heterozygous for the brain sulfate transporter Slc13a4 have abnormal social interactions, memory, exploratory behaviors, stress and anxiety of postnatal origin, pointing to potential deficits in PNN biology, and implicate SLC13A4 as a critical factor required for regulating normal synaptic connectivity and function. Here, we sought to investigate aberrant PNN formation as a potential mechanism contributing to the functional deficits displayed by Slc13a4 mice. Following social interactions, we reveal reduced neuronal activation in the somatosensory cortex of Slc13a4 mice, and altered inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents. In line with this, we found a reduction in parvalbumin-expressing neurons decorated with PNNs, as well as reduced expression of markers for PNN maturation. Finally, we reveal that postnatal administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented PNN abnormalities from manifesting in Slc13a4 adult animals. Collectively, these data highlight a central role for postnatal SLC13A4 in normal PNN formation, circuit function and subsequent animal behavior.',\n",

The dorsomedial part of the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus (Vpdm) has direct projection to the cerebellum. The experimental unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) has an impact on the motor nuclei in the brain stem via trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vme). The current aim was to explore whether UAC has an impact on Vpdm-cerebellum circuit. The inferior alveolar nerve was injected into cholera toxin B subunit (CTb), the cerebellum was injected into fluoro-gold (FG), and the Vpdm was injected into biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) to identify the activation of Vpdm-cerebellum circuit by UAC. Data indicated that there were more neuronal nuclei (NeuN)/CTb/FG triple-labelled neurons and NeuN/CTb/vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGLUT1) triple-labelled neurons in the Vpdm, and more NeuN/BDA/ VGLUT1 triple-labelled neurons in the cerebellum of rats with UAC than in control rats. The VGLUT1 expression in the Vpdm and cerebellum in the UAC group was higher than that in control rats.

Some of these stress-induced behavioural deficits are mediated by impaired hippocampal function. Much of our current understanding about how stress affects the hippocampus has been derived from post-mortem analyses of brain slices at fixed time points. Consequently, neural signatures of an ongoing stressful experiences in the intact brain of awake animals and their links to later hippocampal dysfunction remain poorly understood. Further, no information is available on the impact of stress on sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs), high frequency oscillation transients crucial for memory consolidation. Here, we used  tetrode recordings to analyze the dynamic impact of 10 days of immobilization stress on neural activity in area CA1 of mice. While there was a net decrease in pyramidal cell activity in stressed animals, a greater fraction of CA1 spikes occurred specifically during sharp-wave ripples, resulting in an increase in neuronal synchrony. After repeated stress some of these alterations were visible during rest even in the absence of stress. These findings offer new insights into stress-induced changes in ripple-spike interactions and mechanisms through which chronic stress may interfere with subsequent information processing.',\n",

Light input analysis confirms that CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) is the primary circadian photoreceptor and mediates clock disruption by constant light (LL), and that eye light input is redundant to CRY; 3-h light phase delays (Friday) followed by 3-h light phase advances (Monday morning) simulate the common practice of staying up later at night on weekends, sleeping in later on weekend days then returning to standard schedule Monday morning [weekend light shift (WLS)]. PER and TIM oscillations are highly synchronous across all major circadian neuronal subgroups in unshifted light schedules for 11\\u2009d. In contrast, WLS significantly dampens PER oscillator synchrony and rhythmicity in most circadian neurons during and after exposure. Lateral ventral neuron (LNv) oscillations are the first to desynchronize in WLS and the last to resynchronize in WLS. Surprisingly, the dorsal neuron group-3 (DN3s) increase their within-group synchrony in response to WLS. , WLS induces transient defects in sleep stability, learning, and memory that temporally coincide with circuit desynchrony. Our findings suggest that WLS schedules disrupt circuit-wide circadian neuronal oscillator synchrony for much of the week, thus leading to observed behavioral defects in sleep, learning, and memory.',\n",

This effect disappeared in the anosmic model mice, indicating that olfactory input evoked by linalool odor triggered this effect. Furthermore, hypothalamic orexinergic neurons play a pivotal role in this effect. However, the neuronal circuit mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully addressed. In this study, we focused on the descending orexinergic projection to the spinal cord and examined whether this pathway contributes to the effect. We assessed the effect of intrathecal administration of orexin receptor antagonists on linalool odor-induced analgesia in the tail capsaicin test. We found that the selective orexin type 1 receptor antagonist, but not the selective orexin type 2 receptor antagonist, prevented the odor-induced analgesic effect. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses of c-Fos expression induced by the capsaicin test revealed that neuronal activity of spinal cord neurons was suppressed by linalool odor exposure, which was prevented by intrathecal administration of the orexin 1 receptor antagonist. These results indicate that linalool odor exposure drives the orexinergic descending pathway and suppresses nociceptive information flow at the spinal level.',\n",

In this study, we use a biologically-plausible model of the dorsal horn circuitry as a platform to simulate pain processing under healthy and pathological conditions. Specifically, we distort signals in the receptor fibers akin to what is observed in axonal damage and monitor the corresponding changes in five quantitative markers associated with the pain response. Axonal damage may lead to spike-train delays, evoked potentials, an increase in the refractoriness of the system, and intermittent blockage of spikes. We demonstrate how such effects applied to mechanoreceptor and nociceptor fibers in the pain processing circuit can give rise to dramatically distinct responses at the network/population level. The computational modeling of damaged neuronal assemblies may help unravel the myriad of responses observed in painful neuropathies and improve diagnostics and treatment protocols.',\n",

SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.',\n",

Moreover, neuropathic pain occurs in the maxillofacial region due to various factors and is treated using tricyclic antidepressants and nerve block therapy; however, some cases do not fully recover. Netrin is a secreted protein crucially involved in neural circuit formation during development, including cell migration, cell death, neurite formation, and synapse formation. Recent studies show Netrin-4 expressed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord is associated with chronic pain. Here we found involvement of Netrin-4 in neuropathic pain in the maxillofacial region. Netrin-4, along with one of its receptors, Unc5B, are expressed in the caudal subnucleus of the trigeminal spinal tract nucleus. Inhibition of its binding by anti-Netrin-4 antibodies not only shows a behavioral analgesic effect but also neuronal activity suppression. There was increased Netrin-4 expression at 14 days after infraorbital nerve injury. Our findings suggest that Netrin-4 induced by peripheral nerve injury causes neuropathic pain via Unc5B.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Carbon monoxide (CO), generated by heme oxygenase (HO), has been considered a signaling molecule in both the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. The biological function of the HO/CO axis is mostly related to other gaseous molecules, including nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Healthy blood vessels are essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and whole-body metabolism; however, decreased or impaired vascular function is a high-risk factor of cardiovascular and neuronal diseases. Accumulating evidence supports that the interplay between CO and NO plays a crucial role in vascular homeostasis and regeneration by improving endothelial function. Moreover, endothelial cells communicate with neighboring cells, such as, smooth muscle cells, immune cells, pericytes, and astrocytes in the periphery and neuronal vascular systems. Endogenous CO could mediate the cell-cell communication and improve the physiological functions of the cardiovascular and neurovascular systems  crosstalk with NO. Thus, a forward, positive feedback circuit between HO/CO and NOS/NO pathways can maintain cardiovascular and neurovascular homeostasis and prevent various human diseases. We discussed the crucial role of CO-NO crosstalk in the cardiovascular and neurovascular systems.',\n",

In utero labeling of Tα1-expressing apical intermediate progenitors (aIP), as well as other progenitors (OP), reveals that both progenitors generate direct and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) with similar electrophysiological and anatomical properties and are intermingled in medial striatum. Subsequent optogenetic circuit-mapping experiments demonstrate that progenitor origin significantly impacts long-range excitatory input strength, with medial prefrontal cortex preferentially driving aIP-derived SPNs and visual cortex preferentially driving OP-derived SPNs. In contrast, the strength of local inhibitory inputs among SPNs is controlled by birthdate rather than progenitor origin.

       "  'abstract': 'Coordination of skilled movements and motor planning relies on the formation of regionally restricted brain circuits that connect cortex with subcortical areas during embryonic development. Layer 5 neurons that are distributed across most cortical areas innervate the pontine nuclei (basilar pons) by protrusion and extension of collateral branches interstitially along their corticospinal extending axons. Pons-derived chemotropic cues are known to attract extending axons, but molecules that regulate collateral extension to create regionally segregated targeting patterns have not been identified. Here, we discovered that  and  are expressed in the cortex and the basilar pons in a region-specific and mutually exclusive manner, and that their repulsive activities are essential for segregating collateral extensions from corticospinal axonal tracts in mice. Specifically,  and  forward and reverse inhibitory signals direct collateral extension such that -positive frontal and occipital cortical areas extend their axon collaterals into the -negative rostral part of the basilar pons, whereas -positive parietal cortical areas extend their collaterals into the -negative caudal part of the basilar pons. Together, our results provide a molecular basis that explains how the corticopontine projection connects multimodal cortical outputs to their subcortical targets. Our findings put forward a model in which region-to-region connections between cortex and subcortical areas are shaped by mutually exclusive molecules to ensure the fidelity of regionally restricted circuitry. This model is distinct from earlier work showing that neuronal circuits within individual cortical modalities form in a topographical manner controlled by a gradient of axon guidance molecules. The principle that a shared molecular program of mutually repulsive signaling instructs regional organization-both within each brain region and between connected brain regions-may well be applicable to other contexts in which information is sorted by converging and diverging neuronal circuits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Early postnatal experience shapes both inhibitory and excitatory networks in the hippocampus. However, the underlying circuit plasticity is unclear. Using an enriched environment (EE) paradigm during the preweaning period in mice of either sex, we assessed the circuit plasticity of inhibitory cell types in the hippocampus. We found that cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing basket cells strongly increased somatic inhibition on the excitatory granular cells (GCs) following EE, whereas another pivotal inhibitory cell type, parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells, did not show changes. Using electrophysiological analysis and the use of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) agonist WIN 55 212-2, we demonstrate that the change in somatic inhibition from CCK+ neurons increases CB1R-mediated inhibition in the circuit. By inhibiting activity of the entorhinal cortex (EC) using a chemogenetic approach, we further demonstrate that the activity of the projections from the EC mediates the developmental assembly of CCK+ basket cell network. Altogether, our study places the experience-dependent remodeling of CCK+ basket cell innervation as a central process to adjust inhibition in the dentate gyrus and shows that cortical inputs to the hippocampus play an instructional role in controlling the refinement of the synaptic connections during the preweaning period. Brain plasticity is triggered by experience during postnatal brain development and shapes the maturing neural circuits. In humans, altered experience-dependent plasticity can have long-lasting detrimental effects on circuit function and lead to psychiatric disorders. Yet, the cellular mechanisms governing how early experience fine-tunes the maturing synaptic network is not fully understood. Here, taking advantage of an enrichment-housing paradigm, we unravel a new plasticity mechanism involved in the maintenance of the inhibitory to excitatory balance in the hippocampus. Our findings demonstrate that cortical activity instructs the assembly of the CCK+ basket cell network. Considering the importance of this specific cell type for learning and memory, experience-dependent remodeling of CCK+ cells may be a critical determinant for establishing appropriate neural networks.',\n",

In the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice, synapses between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons tend to be stronger for neurons that respond to similar stimulus features, although these neurons are not topographically arranged according to their stimulus preference. The presence of such excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) neuronal assemblies indicates a stimulus-specific form of feedback inhibition. Here, we show that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity on input and output synapses of PV interneurons generates a circuit structure that is consistent with mouse V1. Computational modeling reveals that both forms of plasticity must act in synergy to form the observed E/I assemblies. Once established, these assemblies produce a stimulus-specific competition between pyramidal neurons. Our model suggests that activity-dependent plasticity can refine inhibitory circuits to actively shape cortical computations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) generates the mental representations that are the foundation of abstract thought, and provides top-down regulation of emotion through projections to the medial PFC and cingulate cortices. Physiological recordings from dlPFC Delay cells have shown that the generation of mental representations during working memory relies on NMDAR neurotransmission, with surprisingly little contribution from AMPAR. Systemic administration of low \"antidepressant\" doses of the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, erodes these representations and reduces dlPFC Delay cell firing. In contrast to the dlPFC, V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depends on AMPAR, with much less contribution from NMDAR. Similarly, neurons in the dlPFC that respond to sensory events (cue cells, response feedback cells) rely on AMPAR, and systemic ketamine increases their firing. Insults to NMDAR transmission, and the impaired ability for dlPFC to generate mental representations, may contribute to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, e.g., from genetic insults that weaken NMDAR transmission, or from blockade of NMDAR by kynurenic acid. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid in dlPFC may also contribute to cognitive deficits in other disorders with pronounced neuroinflammation (e.g., Alzheimer\\'s disease), or peripheral infections where kynurenine can enter brain (e.g., delirium from sepsis, \"brain fog\" in COVID19). Much less is known about NMDAR actions in the primate cingulate cortices. However, NMDAR neurotransmission appears to process the affective and visceral responses to pain and other aversive experiences mediated by the cingulate cortices, which may contribute to sustained alterations in mood state. We hypothesize that the very rapid, antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine may involve the disruption of NMDAR-generated aversive mood states by the anterior and subgenual cingulate cortices, providing a \"foot in the door\" to allow the subsequent return of top-down regulation by higher PFC areas. Thus, the detrimental vs. therapeutic effects of NMDAR blockade may be circuit dependent.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Spinal reflex is essential to the robust locomotion of quadruped animals. To investigate the reflex mechanisms, we developed a quadruped robot platform that emulates the neuromuscular dynamics of animals. The leg is designed to be highly back-drivable, and four Hill-type muscles and neuronal pathways are simulated on each leg using software. By searching for the reflex circuit that contributes to the generation of steady gait in cats through robotic experiments, we found a simple reflex circuit that could produce leg trajectories and a steady gait. In addition, this circuit can reproduce the experimental behavior observed in cats. As a major contribution of this study, we show that the underlying structure of the reflex circuit is the reciprocal coupling between extensor muscles via excitatory neural pathways. In the walking experiments on the robot, a steady gait and experimental behaviors of walking cats emerged from the reflex circuit without any central pattern generators. Furthermore, to take advantage of walking experiments using a neurophysiological robotic platform, we conducted experiments in which a part of the proposed reflex circuit was disconnected for a certain period of time during walking. The results showed that the prolongation of the stance phase caused by the reciprocal excitatory reflex contributed greatly to the generation of a steady gait.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Movement has a prominent impact on activity in sensory cortex, but has opposing effects on visual and auditory cortex. Both cortical areas feature a vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) disinhibitory circuit, which in visual cortex contributes to the effect of running. In auditory cortex, however, the role of VIP circuitry in running effects remains poorly understood. Running and optogenetic VIP activation are known to differentially modulate sound-evoked activity in auditory cortex, but it is unknown how these effects vary across cortical layers, and whether laminar differences in the roles of VIP circuitry could contribute to the substantial diversity that has been observed in the effects of both movement and VIP activation. Here we asked whether VIP neurons contribute to the effects of running, across the layers of auditory cortex. We found that both running and optogenetic activation of VIP neurons produced diverse changes in the firing rates of auditory cortical neurons, but with distinct effects on spontaneous and evoked activity and with different patterns across cortical layers. On average, running increased spontaneous firing rates but decreased evoked firing rates, resulting in a reduction of the neuronal encoding of sound. This reduction in sound encoding was observed in all cortical layers, but was most pronounced in layer 2/3. In contrast, VIP activation increased both spontaneous and evoked firing rates, and had no net population-wide effect on sound encoding, but strongly suppressed sound encoding in layer 4 narrow-spiking neurons. These results suggest that VIP activation and running act independently, which we then tested by comparing the arithmetic sum of the two effects measured separately to the actual combined effect of running and VIP activation, which were closely matched. We conclude that the effects of locomotion in auditory cortex are not mediated by the VIP network.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Non-human primate (NHP) models are essential for developing and translating new treatments that target neural circuit dysfunction underlying human psychopathology. As a proof-of-concept for treating neuropsychiatric disorders, we used a NHP model of pathological anxiety to investigate the feasibility of decreasing anxiety by chemogenetically (DREADDs [designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs]) reducing amygdala neuronal activity. Intraoperative MRI surgery was used to infect dorsal amygdala neurons with AAV5-hSyn-HA-hM4Di in young rhesus monkeys. In\\xa0vivo microPET studies with [C]-deschloroclozapine and postmortem autoradiography with [H]-clozapine demonstrated selective hM4Di binding in the amygdala, and neuronal expression of hM4Di was confirmed with immunohistochemistry. Additionally, because of its high affinity for DREADDs, and its approved use in humans, we developed an individualized, low-dose clozapine administration strategy to induce DREADD-mediated amygdala inhibition. Compared to controls, clozapine selectively decreased anxiety-related freezing behavior in the human intruder paradigm in hM4Di-expressing monkeys, while coo vocalizations and locomotion were unaffected. These results are an important step in establishing chemogenetic strategies for patients with refractory neuropsychiatric disorders in which amygdala alterations are central to disease pathophysiology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is the origin of dopaminergic neurons and the dopamine (DA) reward pathway. This pathway has been widely studied in addiction and drug reinforcement studies and is believed to be the central\\xa0processing component\\xa0of\\xa0the reward circuit. In this study, we used a well-established rat model to expose mother dams to alcohol, nicotine-alcohol, and saline perinatally. DA and non-DA neurons collected from the VTA of the rat pups were used to study expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs. miRNA pathway interactions, putative miRNA-mRNA target pairs, and downstream modulated biological pathways were analyzed. In the DA neurons, 4607 genes were differentially upregulated and 4682 were differentially downregulated following nicotine-alcohol exposure. However, in the non-DA neurons, only 543 genes were differentially upregulated and 506 were differentially downregulated. Cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival pathways were enriched after the treatments. Specifically, in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, there were 41 miRNAs and 136 mRNAs differentially expressed in the DA neurons while only 16 miRNAs and 20 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the non-DA neurons after the nicotine-alcohol exposure. These results depicted that chronic nicotine and alcohol exposures during pregnancy differentially affect both miRNA and gene expression profiles more in DA than the non-DA neurons in the VTA. Understanding how the expression signatures representing specific neuronal subpopulations become enriched in the VTA after addictive substance administration helps us to identify how neuronal functions may be altered in the brain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The hippocampus, particularly its ventral domain, can promote negative affective states (i.e. stress and anxiety) that play an integral role in the development and persistence of alcohol use disorder (AUD). The ventral hippocampus (vHC) receives strong excitatory input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the BLA-vHC projection bidirectionally modulates anxiety-like behaviors. However, no studies have examined the effects of chronic alcohol on the BLA-vHC circuit. In the present study, we used ex vivo electrophysiology in conjunction with optogenetic approaches to examine the effects of chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE), a well-established rodent model of AUD, on the BLA-vHC projection and putative intrinsic vHC synaptic plasticity. We discovered prominent BLA innervation in the subicular region of the vHC (vSub). CIE led to an overall increase in the excitatory/inhibitory balance, an increase in AMPA/NMDA ratios but no change in paired-pulse ratios, consistent with a postsynaptic increase in excitability in the BLA-vSub circuit. CIE treatment also led to an increase in intrinsic network excitability in the vSub. Overall, our findings suggest a hyperexcitable state in BLA-vSub specific inputs as well as intrinsic inputs to vSub pyramidal neurons which may contribute to the negative affective behaviors associated with CIE.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Across mammalian species, patterned activity in neural populations is a prominent feature of developing sensory cortices. Numerous studies have long appreciated the diversity of these patterns, characterizing their differences in spatial and temporal dynamics. In the murine somatosensory cortex, neuronal co-activation is thought to guide the formation of sensory maps and prepare the cortex for sensory processing after birth. While pioneering studies deftly utilized slice electrophysiology and unit recordings to characterize correlated activity, a detailed understanding of the underlying circuits remains poorly understood. More recently, advances in in vivo calcium imaging in awake mouse pups and increasing genetic tractability of neuronal types have allowed unprecedented manipulation of circuit components at select developmental timepoints. These novel approaches have proven fundamental in uncovering the identity of neurons engaged in correlated activity during development. In particular, recent studies have highlighted interneurons as key in refining the spatial extent and temporal progression of patterned activity. Here, we discuss how emergent synchronous activity across the first postnatal weeks is shaped by underlying gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic contributors in the somatosensory cortex. Further, the importance of participation in specific activity patterns per se for neuronal maturation and perdurance will be of particular highlight in this survey of recent literature. Finally, we underscore how aberrant neuronal synchrony and disrupted inhibitory interneuron activity underlie sensory perturbations in neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), emphasizing the importance of future investigative approaches that incorporate the spatiotemporal features of patterned activity alongside the cellular components to probe disordered circuit assembly.',\n",

Lin and colleagues in a 2014 article in the journal  demonstrate how sparse coding in the olfactory learning and memory center of  can influence learning behavior. Coding sparsity is the idea that only a small number of neurons in a network represent any given stimulus. Using neurogenetics, computational neuroscience, and cognitive approaches, they outline the discovery of an inhibitory feedback circuit responsible for differentiating the neuronal response to different odors. Manipulating this feedback circuit, they demonstrate how the sparseness in neural networks (how easily neurons are activated) can correspond to the ability to learn a sensory discrimination more easily. From a research perspective, this paper was important as it was the first causal demonstration of the role of sparseness in learning. From a teaching point of view, this paper is valuable because it is a simple but effective introduction to artificial neural network theory, where both the abstract theory and the importance of its application is apparent to those without a mathematical or computational background.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Microglia have been implicated in synapse remodeling by phagocytosis of synaptic elements in the adult brain, but the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this process are ill-defined. By examining microglia-neuronal interaction in the ventral hippocampus, we found a significant reduction in spine synapse number during the light phase of the light/dark cycle accompanied by increased microglia-synapse contacts and an elevated amount of microglial phagocytic inclusions. This was followed by a transient rise in microglial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a concurrent increase in expression of uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2), a regulator of mitochondrial ROS generation. Conditional ablation of Ucp2 from microglia hindered phasic elimination of spine synapses with consequent accumulations of ROS and lysosome-lipid droplet complexes, which resulted in hippocampal neuronal circuit dysfunctions assessed by electrophysiology, and altered anxiety-like behavior. These observations unmasked a novel and chronotypical interaction between microglia and neurons involved in the control of brain functions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the striatal system of both humans and non-human primates (NHP) over the last few decades. However, its circuit-level functional anatomy remains poorly understood, partly because in-vivo fMRI cannot directly perturb a brain system and map its casual input-output relationship. Also, routine 3T fMRI has an insufficient spatial resolution. We performed electrical microstimulation (EM) of the striatum in lightly-anesthetized NHPs while simultaneously mapping whole-brain activation, using contrast-enhanced fMRI at ultra-high-field 7T. By stimulating multiple positions along the striatum's main (dorsal-to-ventral) axis, we revealed its complex functional circuit concerning mutually connected subsystems in both cortical and subcortical areas. Indeed, within the striatum, there were distinct brain activation patterns across different stimulation sites. Specifically, dorsal stimulation revealed a medial-to-lateral elongated shape of activation in upper caudate and putamen areas, whereas ventral stimulation evoked areas confined to the medial and lower caudate. Such dorsoventral gradients also appeared in neocortical and thalamic activations, indicating consistent embedding profiles of the striatal system across the whole brain. These findings reflect different forms of within-circuit and inter-regional neuronal connectivity between the dorsal and ventromedial striatum. These patterns both shared and contrasted with previous anatomical tract-tracing and in-vivo resting-state fMRI studies. Our approach of combining microstimulation and whole-brain fMRI mapping in NHPs provides a unique opportunity to integrate our understanding of a targeted brain area's meso- and macro-scale functional systems.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Research suggest that in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) a disturbance in the coordinated interactions of neurons within local networks gives rise to abnormal patterns of brainwave activity in the gamma bandwidth. Low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been proven to normalize gamma oscillation abnormalities, executive functions, and repetitive behaviors in high functioning ASD individuals. In this study, gamma frequency oscillations in response to a visual classification task (Kanizsa figures) were analyzed and compared in 19 ASD (ADI-R diagnosed, 14.2\\u2009±\\u20093.61\\xa0years old, 5 girls) and 19 (14.8\\u2009±\\u20093.67\\xa0years old, 5 girls) age/gender matched neurotypical individuals. The ASD group was treated with low frequency TMS (1.0\\xa0Hz, 90% motor threshold, 18 weekly sessions) targeting the DLPFC. In autistic subjects, as compared to neurotypicals, significant differences in event-related gamma oscillations were evident in amplitude (higher) pre-TMS. In addition, recordings after TMS treatment in our autistic subjects revealed a significant reduction in the time period to reach peak amplitude and an increase in the decay phase (settling time). The use of a novel metric for gamma oscillations. i.e., envelope analysis, and measurements of its ringing decay allowed us to characterize the impedance of the originating neuronal circuit. The ringing decay or dampening of gamma oscillations is dependent on the inhibitory tone generated by networks of interneurons. The results suggest that the ringing decay of gamma oscillations may provide a biomarker reflective of the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the cortex and a putative outcome measure for interventions in autism.',\n",

Although different neurotransmitters regulate various aspects of the progression from neural stem cell quiescence to neuronal maturation, GABA is the main player. The developmental switch from excitation to inhibition combined with a heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons that target different subcellular compartments provides multiple points for the regulation of development and function of new neurons. This complexity is enhanced by feedback and feedforward networks that act as sensors and controllers of circuit activity, impinging directly or indirectly onto\\xa0developing granule cells and, subsequently, on mature neurons.

       "  'abstract': 'Experience-dependent plasticity within visual cortex is controlled by postnatal maturation of inhibitory circuits, which are both morphologically diverse and precisely connected. Gene-targeted disruption of the voltage-dependent potassium channel K3.1 broadens action potentials and reduces net inhibitory function of parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABA subtypes within the neocortex. In mice lacking K3.1, the rate of input loss from an eye deprived of vision was slowed two-fold, despite otherwise normal critical period timecourse and receptive field properties. Rapid ocular dominance plasticity was restored by local or systemic enhancement of GABAergic transmission with acute benzodiazepine infusion. Diazepam instead exacerbated a global suppression of slow-wave oscillations during sleep described previously in these mutant mice, which therefore did not account for the rescued plasticity. Rapid ocular dominance shifts closely reflected K3.1 gene dosage that prevented prolonged spike discharge of their target pyramidal cells in vivo or the spike amplitude decrement of fast-spiking cells during bouts of high-frequency firing in vitro. Late postnatal expression of this unique channel in fast-spiking interneurons thus subtly regulates the speed of critical period plasticity with implications for mental illnesses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although the general architecture of the hippocampus is similar along its longitudinal axis, recent studies have revealed prominent differences in molecular, anatomical and functional criteria suggesting a division into different sub-circuits along its rostro-caudal extent. Owing to differential connectivity and function the most fundamental distinction is made between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus, which are preferentially involved in spatial and emotional processing, respectively. Accordingly, in vivo work regarding spatial memory formation has focused on the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, electro-physiological in vitro recordings have been preferentially performed on intermediate-ventral hippocampus, largely motivated by factors like slice viability and circuit integrity. To allow for direct correlation of in vivo data on spatial processing with in vitro data we have adapted previous sectioning methods to obtain highly viable transverse brain slices from the dorsal-intermediate hippocampus for long-term recordings of principal cells and interneurons in the dentate gyrus. As spatial behavior is routinely analyzed in adult mice, we have combined this transversal slicing procedure with the use of protective solutions to enhance viability of brain tissue from mature animals. We use this approach for mice of about 3 months of age. The method offers a good alternative to the coronal preparation which is frequently used for in vitro studies on dorsal hippocampus. We compare these two preparations in terms of quality of recordings and preservation of morphological features of recorded neurons.',\n",

However, it is unknown whether cocaine withdrawal modulates LHb neurotransmission onto subsets of VTA neurons that are part of distinct neuronal circuits. Here we show that, in mice, cocaine withdrawal, drives discrete and opposing synaptic adaptations at LHb inputs onto VTA neurons defined by their output synaptic connectivity. LHb axons innervate the medial aspect of VTA, release glutamate and synapse on to dopamine and non-dopamine neuronal populations. VTA neurons receiving LHb inputs project their axons to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and lateral hypothalamus (LH). While cocaine withdrawal increases glutamate release from LHb onto VTA-mPFC projectors, it reduces presynaptic release onto VTA-NAc projectors, leaving LHb synapses onto VTA-to-LH unaffected. Altogether, cocaine withdrawal promotes distinct adaptations at identified LHb-to-VTA circuits, which provide a framework for understanding the circuit basis of the negative states emerging during abstinence of drug intake.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is part of a complex circuit controlling stress responses by sending projections to different limbic structures including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). However, the impact of chronic stress on NAc- and VTA-projecting mPFC neurons is still unknown, and the distinct contribution of these pathways to stress responses in males and females is unclear. Behavioral stress responses were induced by 21 days of chronic variable stress in male and female C57BL/6NCrl mice. An intersectional viral approach was used to label both pathways and assess the functional, morphological, and transcriptional adaptations in NAc- and VTA-projecting mPFC neurons in stressed males and females. Using chemogenetic approaches, we modified neuronal activity of NAc-projecting mPFC neurons to decipher their contribution to stress phenotypes. Chronic variable stress induced depressive-like behaviors in males and females. NAc- and VTA-projecting mPFC neurons exhibited sex-specific functional, morphological, and transcriptional alterations. The functional changes were more severe in females in NAc-projecting mPFC neurons, while males exhibited more drastic reductions in dendritic complexity in VTA-projecting mPFC neurons after chronic variable stress. Finally, chemogenetic overactivation of the corticoaccumbal pathway triggered anxiety and behavioral despair in both sexes, while its inhibition rescued the phenotype only in females. Our results suggest that stress responses in males and females result from pathway-specific changes in the activity of transcriptional programs controlling the morphological and synaptic properties of corticoaccumbal and corticotegmental pathways in a sex-specific fashion.

       "  'abstract': \"Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), open membranous channels between connected cells, represent a novel direct way of communication between distant cells for the diffusion of various cellular material, including survival or death signals, genetic material, organelles, and pathogens. Their discovery prompted us to review our understanding of many physiological and pathological processes involving cellular communication but also allowed us to discover new mechanisms of communication at a distance. While this has enriched the field, it has also generated some confusion, as different TNT-like protrusions have been described, and it is not clear whether they have the same structure-function. Most studies have been based on low-resolution imaging methods, and one of the major problems is the inconsistency in demonstrating the capacity of these various connections to transfer material between cells belonging to different populations. This brief review examines the fundamental properties of TNTs. In adult tissues, TNTs are stimulated by different diseases, stresses, and inflammatory signals. 'Moreover', based on the similarity of the processes of development of synaptic spines and TNT formation, we argue that TNTs in the brain predate synaptic transmission, being instrumental in the orchestration of the immature neuronal circuit.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Neural circuit functions are stabilized by homeostatic processes at long timescales in response to changes in behavioral states, experience, and learning. However, it remains unclear which specific physiological variables are being stabilized and which cellular or neural network components compose the homeostatic machinery. At this point, most evidence suggests that the distribution of firing rates among neurons in a neuronal circuit is the key variable that is maintained around a set-point value in a process called 'firing rate homeostasis.' Here, we review recent findings that implicate mitochondria as central players in mediating firing rate homeostasis. While mitochondria are known to regulate neuronal variables such as synaptic vesicle release or intracellular calcium concentration, the mitochondrial signaling pathways that are essential for firing rate homeostasis remain largely unknown. We used basic concepts of control theory to build a framework for classifying possible components of the homeostatic machinery that stabilizes firing rate, and we particularly emphasize the potential role of sleep and wakefulness in this homeostatic process. This framework may facilitate the identification of new homeostatic pathways whose malfunctions drive instability of neural circuits in distinct brain disorders.\",\n",

Therefore, we investigated neuro-regenerative potential of melatonin (Mel), a natural biomaterial secreted by pineal gland. We specifically determined whether Mel could influence tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-mediated transfer of functional mitochondria (Mito) which in turn may alter membrane potential, oxidative stress and apoptotic factors. In vitro studies assessed the effects of Mito on levels of cytochrome C, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species, membrane potential and mass, which were all further enhanced by Mel pre-treatment, whereas in vivo studies examined brain infarct area (BIA), neurological function, inflammation, brain edema and integrity of neurons and myelin sheath in control, ischemia stroke (IS), IS\\xa0+\\xa0Mito and IS\\xa0+\\xa0Mel-Mito group rats. Results showed that Mel pre-treatment significantly increased mitochondrial transfer and antioxidants, and inhibited apoptosis. Mel-pretreated Mito also significantly reduced BIA with improved neurological function. Apoptotic, oxidative-stress, autophagic, mitochondrial/DNA-damaged biomarkers indices were also improved. Conclusively, Mel is a potent biomaterial which could potentially impart neurogenesis through repairing impaired metabolic-redox circuit via enhanced TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer, anti-oxidation, and anti-apoptotic activities in ischemia.

       "  'abstract': \"In the adult hippocampus, synaptic plasticity is important for information processing, learning, and memory encoding. Astrocytes, the most common glial cells, play a pivotal role in the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. While astrocytes were initially described as a homogenous cell population, emerging evidence indicates that in the adult hippocampus, astrocytes are highly heterogeneous and can differentially respond to changes in neuronal activity in a subregion-dependent manner to actively modulate synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize how local neuronal activity changes regulate the interactions between astrocytes and synapses, either by modulating the secretion of gliotransmitters and synaptogenic proteins or via contact-mediated signaling pathways. In turn, these specific responses induced in astrocytes mediate the interactions between astrocytes and neurons, thus shaping synaptic communication in the adult hippocampus. Importantly, the activation of astrocytic signaling is required for memory performance including memory acquisition and recall. Meanwhile, the dysregulation of this signaling can cause hippocampal circuit dysfunction in pathological conditions, resulting in cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Indeed, reactive astrocytes, which have dysregulated signaling associated with memory, are induced in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and transgenic mouse model of AD. Emerging technologies that can precisely manipulate and monitor astrocytic signaling in\\u2009vivo enable the examination of the specific actions of astrocytes in response to neuronal activity changes as well as how they modulate synaptic connections and circuit activity. Such findings will clarify the roles of astrocytes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory in health and disease.\",\n",

A growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant neurotransmission, caused by changes in synaptic protein expression levels, may be a major cause underlying different brain disorders. These changes in expression result in abnormal synaptic organization or function, leading to impaired neurotransmission and unbalanced circuit operations. Here, we review the data supporting the involvement of mutations in genes coding for kainate receptor (KAR) subunits in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and Down syndrome (DS). We show that most of these mutations do not affect the biophysical properties or the receptors, but rather alter subunit expression levels. On the basis of reports studying KAR genes mutations in mouse models of autism spectrum disorders and DS, we illustrate how deviations from the physiological regulatory role that these receptors play in neurotransmitter release and plasticity give rise to synaptic alterations that lead to behavioral and cognitive deficits underlying these disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Traumatic brain injury is a devastating public health problem, the eighth leading cause of death across the world. To improve our understanding of how injury at the cellular scale affects neural circuit function, we developed a protocol to precisely injure individual neurons within an  neural network. We used high speed calcium imaging to estimate alterations in neural activity and connectivity that occur followed targeted microtrauma. Our studies show that mechanically injured neurons inactivate following microtrauma and eventually re-integrate into the network. Single neuron re-integration is dependent on its activity prior to injury and initial connections in the network: more active and integrated neurons are more resistant to microtrauma and more likely to re-integrate into the network. Micromechanical injury leads to neuronal death 6 h post-injury in a subset of both injured and uninjured neurons. Interestingly, neural activity and network participation after injury were associated with survival in linear discriminate analysis (77.3% correct prediction, Wilks' Lambda = 0.838). Based on this observation, we modulated neuronal activity to rescue neurons after microtrauma. Inhibition of neuronal activity provided much greater survivability than did activation of neurons (ANOVA,  < 0.01 with  Tukey HSD,  < 0.01). Rescue of neurons by blocking activity in the post-acute period is partially mediated by mitochondrial energetics, as we observed silencing neurons after micromechanical injury led to a significant reduction in mitochondrial calcium accumulation. Overall, the present study provides deeper insight into the propagation of injury within networks, demonstrating that together the initial activity, network structure, and post-injury activity levels contribute to the progressive changes in a neural circuit after mechanical trauma.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"One consequence of the opioid epidemic are lasting neurodevelopmental sequelae afflicting adolescents exposed to opioids in the womb. A translationally relevant and developmentally accurate preclinical model is needed to understand the behavioral, circuit, network, and molecular abnormalities resulting from this exposure. By employing a novel preclinical model of perinatal fentanyl exposure, our data reveal that fentanyl has several dose-dependent, developmental consequences to somatosensory function and behavior. Newborn male and female mice exhibit signs of withdrawal and sensory-related deficits that extend at least to adolescence. As fentanyl exposure does not affect dams' health or maternal behavior, these effects result from the direct actions of perinatal fentanyl on the pups' developing brain. At adolescence, exposed mice exhibit reduced adaptation to sensory stimuli, and a corresponding impairment in primary somatosensory (S1) function.  electrophysiology demonstrates a long-lasting reduction in S1 synaptic excitation, evidenced by decreases in release probability, NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents, and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), as well as increased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). In contrast, anterior cingulate cortical neurons exhibit an opposite phenotype, with increased synaptic excitation. Consistent with these changes, electrocorticograms (ECoGs) reveal suppressed ketamine-evoked γ oscillations. Morphologic analysis of S1 pyramidal neurons indicate reduced dendritic complexity, dendritic length, and soma size. Further, exposed mice exhibited abnormal cortical mRNA expression of key receptors involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal growth and development, changes that were consistent with the electrophysiological and morphologic changes. These findings demonstrate the lasting sequelae of perinatal fentanyl exposure on sensory processing and function. This is the first study to show that exposure to fentanyl in the womb results in behavioral, circuitry, and synaptic effects that last at least to adolescence. We also show, for the first time, that this exposure has different, lasting effects on synapses in different cortical areas.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Voltage-gated Kv7 ( family) K channels are expressed in many neuronal populations and play an important role in regulating membrane potential by generating a hyperpolarizing K current and decreasing cell excitability. However, the role of K7 channels in the neural regulation of intestinal epithelial Cl secretion is not known. Cl secretion in mouse distal colon was measured as a function of short-circuit current (I), and pharmacological approaches were used to test the hypothesis that activation of K7 channels in enteric neurons would inhibit epithelial Cl secretion. Flupirtine, a nonselective K7 activator, inhibited basal Cl secretion in mouse distal colon and abolished or attenuated the effects of drugs that target various components of enteric neurotransmission, including tetrodotoxin (Na channel blocker), veratridine (Na channel activator), nicotine (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist), and hexamethonium (nicotinic antagonist). In contrast, flupritine did not block the response to epithelium-targeted agents VIP (endogenous VPAC receptor ligand) or carbachol (nonselective cholinergic agonist). Flupirtine inhibited Cl secretion in both full-thickness and seromuscular-stripped distal colon (containing the submucosal, but not myenteric plexus) but generated no response in epithelial T84 cell monolayers. K7.2 and K7.3 channel proteins were detected by immunofluorescence in whole mount preparations of the submucosa from mouse distal colon. ICA 110381 (K7.2/7.3 specific activator) inhibited Cl secretion comparably to flupirtine. We conclude that K7 channel activators inhibit neurally driven Cl secretion in the colonic epithelium and may therefore have therapeutic benefit in treating pathologies associated with hyperexcitable enteric nervous system, such as irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Methylmercury (MeHg) is known to cause serious neurological deficits in humans. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of MeHg-mediated neuropathic pain and identified the underlying pathophysiological mechanism in a rat model of MeHg exposure. Rats were exposed to MeHg (20\\xa0ppm in drinking water) for 3\\xa0weeks. Neurological damage was observed in the primary afferent neuronal system, including the dorsal root nerve and the dorsal column of the spinal cord. The MeHg-exposed rats showed hyperalgesia/allodynia, compared to controls, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the threshold of mechanical pain evaluated using an algometer with calibrated forceps. Immunohistochemistry revealed the accumulation of activated microglia in the dorsal root nerve, dorsal column, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Western blot analyses of the dorsal part of the spinal cord demonstrated an increase in inflammotoxic and inflammatory cytokines and a neuronal activation related protein, phospho-CRE bunding protein (CREB). The results suggest that dorsal horn neuronal activation was mediated by inflammatory factors excreted by accumulated microglia. Furthermore, analyses of the cerebral cortex demonstrated increased expression of phospho-CREB and thrombospondin-1, which is known to be an important factor for excitatory synapse formation, specifically in the somatosensory cortical area. In addition, the expression of pre- and post-synaptic markers was increased in this cortex area. These results suggested that the new cortical circuit was wired specifically in the somatosensory cortex. In conclusion, MeHg-mediated dorsal horn neuronal activation with inflammatory microglia might induce somatosensory cortical rewiring, leading to hyperalgesia/allodynia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The mechanisms controlling wiring of neuronal networks are not completely understood. The stereotypic architecture of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB) offers a unique system to study circuit assembly. The adult medial MB γ-lobe is comprised of a long bundle of axons that wire with specific modulatory and output neurons in a tiled manner, defining five distinct zones. We found that the immunoglobulin superfamily protein Dpr12 is cell-autonomously required in γ-neurons for their developmental regrowth into the distal γ4/5 zones, where both Dpr12 and its interacting protein, DIP-δ, are enriched. DIP-δ functions in a subset of dopaminergic neurons that wire with γ-neurons within the γ4/5 zone. During metamorphosis, these dopaminergic projections arrive to the γ4/5 zone prior to γ-axons, suggesting that γ-axons extend through a prepatterned region. Thus, Dpr12/DIP-δ transneuronal interaction is required for γ4/5 zone formation. Our study sheds light onto molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying circuit formation within subcellular resolution.',\n",

It has been proposed that specific phobia may have an evolutionary origin, and that attentional bias to specific items may promote the onset of phobia. Noninvasive imaging studies of patients with specific phobia reported that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), especially the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and amygdala are activated during the presentation of phobogenic stimuli. We propose that the mPFC-amygdala circuit may be involved in the pathogenesis of phobia. The mPFC receives inputs from the phylogenically old subcortical visual pathway including the superior colliculus, pulvinar, and amygdala, while mPFC neurons are highly sensitive to snakes that are the first modern predator of primates, and discriminate snakes with striking postures from those with non-striking postures. Furthermore, the mPFC has been implicated in the attentional allocation and promotes amygdala-dependent aversive conditioning. These findings suggest that the rACC focuses attention on snakes, and promotes aversive conditioning to snakes, which may lead to anxiety and ophidiophobia.',\n",

In addition to neural mechanisms, the focus of the vast majority of studies to date, astrocytes have been increasingly recognized as an \"accomplice.\" According to the tripartite synapse model, astrocytes critically regulate nearby pre- and postsynaptic neuronal substrates to craft experience-dependent synaptic plasticity, including synapse formation and elimination. Astrocytes within brain regions that are implicated in drug addiction exhibit dynamic changes in activity upon exposure to cocaine and subsequently undergo adaptive changes themselves during chronic drug exposure. Recent results have identified several key astrocytic signaling pathways that are involved in cocaine-induced synaptic and circuit adaptations. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the role of astrocytes in regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal function, and discuss how cocaine influences these astrocyte-mediated mechanisms to induce persistent synaptic and circuit alterations that promote cocaine seeking and relapse. We also consider the therapeutic potential of targeting astrocytic substrates to ameliorate drug-induced neuroplasticity for behavioral benefits. While primarily focusing on cocaine-induced astrocytic responses, we also include brief discussion of other drugs of abuse where data are available.',\n",

The central nervous system contains several important endocrine structures, including the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Conventionally, neurohormones released by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland (hypophysis) have received much attention owing to the unique functions of the end hormones released by their target peripheral organs (e.g., glucocorticoids released by the adrenal glands). Recent advances in mouse genetics have revealed several important metabolic functions of hypothalamic neurohormone-expressing cells, many of which are not readily explained by the action of the corresponding classical downstream hormones. Notably, the newly identified functions are better explained by the action of conventional neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate and GABA) that constitute a neuronal circuit. In this review, we discuss the regulation of appetite and metabolism by hypothalamic neurohormone-expressing cells, with a focus on the distinct contributions of neurohormones and neurotransmitters released by these neurons.',\n",

It plays a critical role in the excessive feeding that underlies obesity. Compared to other pathological motivated behaviors, little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms mediating excessive hedonic feeding. Here, we show that modulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior paraventricular thalamus (aPVT) excitatory inputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key node of reward circuitry, has opposing effects on high fat intake in mice. Prolonged high fat intake leads to input- and cell type-specific changes in synaptic strength. Modifying synaptic strength via plasticity protocols, either in an input-specific optogenetic or non-specific electrical manner, causes sustained changes in high fat intake. These results demonstrate that input-specific NAc circuit adaptations occur with repeated exposure to a potent natural reward and suggest that neuromodulatory interventions may be therapeutically useful for individuals with pathologic hedonic feeding.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'GABAergic neurons are key circuit elements in cortical networks. Despite growing evidence showing that inhibitory cells play a critical role in the lateral (LA) and basal (BA) amygdala functions, neither the number of GABAergic neurons nor the ratio of their distinct types has been determined in these amygdalar nuclei. Using unbiased stereology, we found that the ratio of GABAergic neurons in the BA (22%) is significantly higher than in the LA (16%) in both male and female mice. No difference was observed between the right and left hemispheres in either sex. In addition, we assessed the ratio of the major inhibitory cell types in both amygdalar nuclei. Using transgenic mice and a viral strategy for visualizing inhibitory cells combined with immunocytochemistry, we estimated that the following cell types together compose the vast majority of GABAergic cells in the LA and BA: axo-axonic cells (5.5%-6%), basket cells expressing parvalbumin (17%-20%) or cholecystokinin (7%-9%), dendrite-targeting inhibitory cells expressing somatostatin (10%-16%), NPY-containing neurogliaform cells (14%-15%), VIP and/or calretinin-expressing interneuron-selective interneurons (29%-38%), and GABAergic projection neurons expressing somatostatin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (5.5%-8%). Our results show that these amygdalar nuclei contain all major GABAergic neuron types as found in other cortical regions. Furthermore, our data offer an essential reference for future studies aiming to reveal changes in GABAergic cell number and in inhibitory cell types typically observed under different pathologic conditions, and to model functioning amygdalar networks in health and disease. GABAergic cells in cortical structures, as in the lateral and basal nucleus of the amygdala, have a determinant role in controlling circuit operation. In this study, we provide the first estimate for the total number of inhibitory cells in these two amygdalar nuclei. In addition, our study is the first to define the ratio of the major GABAergic cell types present in these cortical networks. Taking into account that hyperexcitability in the amygdala, arising from the imbalance between excitation and inhibition typifies many altered brain functions, including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and autism, uncovering the number and ratio of distinct amygdalar inhibitory cell types offers a solid base for comparing the changes in inhibition in pathologic brain states.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Type I and type II classical cadherins comprise a family of cell adhesion molecules that regulate cell sorting and tissue separation by forming specific homo and heterophilic bonds. Factors that affect cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion include cadherin binding affinity and expression level. This study examines the expression pattern of type I cadherins (, , , and ), type II cadherins (, , , , , , , , , and ), and the atypical cadherin 13 () during distinct morphogenetic events in the developing mouse central nervous system from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. Cadherin mRNA expression levels obtained from  hybridization experiments carried out at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (https://alleninstitute.org/) were retrieved from the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas.  is the most abundantly expressed type I cadherin throughout development, while , , and  are expressed at low levels. Type II cadherins show a dynamic pattern of expression that varies between neuroanatomical structures and developmental ages. Atypical  expression pattern correlates with  in abundancy and localization. Analyses of cadherin-mediated relative adhesion estimated from their expression level and binding affinity show substantial differences in adhesive properties between regions of the neural tube associated with the segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis. Differences in relative adhesion were also observed between brain nuclei in the developing subpallium (basal ganglia), suggesting that differential cell adhesion contributes to the segregation of neuronal pools. In the adult cerebral cortex, type II cadherins , , , and  are abundant in intermediate layers, while  shows a gradated expression from the deeper layer 6 to the superficial layer 1, and , , and  are more abundant in the deeper layers. Person's correlation analyses of cadherins mRNA expression patterns between areas and layers of the cerebral cortex and the nuclei of the subpallium show significant correlations between certain cortical areas and the basal ganglia. The study shows that differential cadherin expression and cadherin-mediated adhesion are associated with a wide range of morphogenetic events in the developing central nervous system including the organization of neurons into layers, the segregation of neurons into nuclei, and the formation of neuronal circuits.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ample evidence indicates that individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are at increased risk of developing stress-related behavioral problems and mood disorders, yet a mechanistic explanation for such a link remains largely elusive. Here, we focused on characterizing the syndromic ID gene oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1). We find that Ophn1 deficiency in mice markedly enhances helpless/depressive-like behavior in the face of repeated/uncontrollable stress. Strikingly, Ophn1 deletion exclusively in parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (PL-mPFC) is sufficient to induce helplessness. This behavioral phenotype is mediated by a diminished excitatory drive onto Ophn1-deficient PL-mPFC PV interneurons, leading to hyperactivity in this region. Importantly, suppressing neuronal activity or RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling in the PL-mPFC reverses helpless behavior. Our results identify OPHN1 as a critical regulator of adaptive behavioral responses to stress and shed light onto the mechanistic links among OPHN1 genetic deficits, mPFC circuit dysfunction, and abnormalities in stress-related behaviors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sensorimotor integration is a pivotal feature of the nervous system for ensuring a coordinated motor response to external stimuli. In essence, such neural circuits can optimize behavioral performance based on the saliency of environmental cues. In zebrafish, habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) is a simple behavior integrated into the startle command neurons, called the Mauthner cells. Whereas the essential neuronal components that regulate the startle response have been identified, the principles of how this regulation is integrated at the subcellular regions of the Mauthner cell, which in turn modulate the performance of the behavior, is still not well understood. Here, we reveal mechanistically distinct dynamics of excitatory inputs converging onto the lateral dendrite (LD) and axon initial segment (AIS) of the Mauthner cell by  imaging glutamate release using iGluSnFR, an ultrafast glutamate sensing fluorescent reporter. We find that modulation of glutamate release is dependent on NMDA receptor activity exclusively at the AIS, which is responsible for setting the sensitivity of the startle reflex and inducing a depression of synaptic activity during habituation. In contrast, glutamate-release at the LD is not regulated by NMDA receptors and serves as a baseline component of Mauthner cell activation. Finally, using  calcium imaging at the feed-forward interneuron population component of the startle circuit, we reveal that these cells indeed play pivotal roles in both setting the startle threshold and habituation by modulating the AIS of the Mauthner cell. These results indicate that a command neuron may have several functionally distinct regions to regulate complex aspects of behavior.',\n",
